<p>In the vast, sprawling history of country rock—a genre pioneered by legends who blended the dusty soul of Nashville with the melodic complexity of Laurel Canyon—Poco holds a unique and celebrated place. Known for their intricate harmonies, stellar musicianship, and the ever-present sparkle of Rusty Young’s pedal steel, Poco navigated decades of lineup changes. Yet, there was always a specific chemistry that fans cherished, particularly the dynamic trio that held the core together through the late 70s.</p>

<p>That chemistry was reignited in 2002 with the release of their eighteenth studio album, <em>Running Horse</em>. This wasn't just another entry in their extensive catalog; it marked a monumental reunion. For the first time since 1977, the trio of Rusty Young, Paul Cotton, and George Grantham were back together, crafting entirely new material. The album proved that the fire of their songwriting partnership hadn't diminished, delivering a powerful, mature, and deeply authentic slab of classic Poco sound that thrilled long-time fans and solidified the band's enduring legacy.</p>

<h2>The Long Road Back: Why the 1977 Lineup Mattered</h2>

<p>To understand the significance of the <em>Running Horse</em> reunion, one must appreciate the era preceding the break. Following the departure of founding members Richie Furay and Jim Messina, Poco settled into a consistent and highly productive lineup featuring Young and Cotton as the principal creative forces. While the band saw commercial highs with albums like <em>Legend</em> (1980), the specific lineup that solidified the mid-to-late 1970s—Young, Cotton, and drummer George Grantham—developed a hardier, slightly bluesier edge to their country rock foundation.</p>

<p>Grantham had joined the group in 1969, providing the rhythmic backbone throughout their classic early records. Cotton, arriving in 1970, brought a sophisticated songwriting voice that contrasted well with Young’s smooth country tendencies. This iteration of the band was responsible for influential records such as <em>Cantamos</em> (1974) and <em>Indian Summer</em> (1977). When Grantham stepped away after <em>Indian Summer</em>, the defining structure of that era dissolved, leaving fans hoping that the confluence of these specific talents would one day return.</p>

<p>Decades passed, featuring various incarnations and successful projects, including the 1989 comeback album <em>Legacy</em> (which reunited Furay, Messina, Young, and Schmit). However, the specific, gritty energy generated by the Young/Cotton/Grantham core remained dormant until the dawn of the new millennium. The decision to reunite for new material, rather than simply touring on nostalgia, signaled a genuine artistic commitment to the project.</p>

<h2><em>Running Horse</em>: The Call of the Open Range</h2>

<p>The genesis of <em>Running Horse</em> stemmed from a desire to recapture the organic feel that characterized Poco's recording process in its prime. Released in 2002, the album was a testament to the fact that friendship and musical compatibility often trump industry trends. Rather than conforming to contemporary production styles, the album embraced a classic, warm, studio sound, allowing the musicianship to shine through.</p>

<p>The title track itself, penned by Paul Cotton, is a perfect distillation of the band's ethos—a blend of freedom, motion, and a nostalgic gaze toward the horizon. It immediately re-establishes Cotton’s talent for crafting narrative, driving rock tunes imbued with a sense of Americana. The song acts as an anthem for the album, symbolizing not just the band’s iconic logo, but the energy of a renewed, unbridled musical journey.</p>

<p>The recording of <em>Running Horse</em> saw the band members sharing duties and providing the kind of tight, lived-in harmonies that only decades of shared history can produce. While Young had carried the Poco name forward virtually single-handedly for years, bringing Cotton and Grantham back injected a vital, collaborative spirit that had been missing from the band’s output.</p>

<h2>Track-by-Track Synergy: Analyzing the Chemistry</h2>

<p>What truly elevates <em>Running Horse</em> is the impeccable balance between Young's soaring, often heartbreakingly beautiful steel work and Cotton’s robust, blues-infused guitar playing. The album is a masterclass in mature country rock, avoiding the pitfalls of overproduction and leaning heavily into honest, heartfelt songwriting. The tracks on the record demonstrate how each member’s unique strengths complemented the others:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>“Running Horse” (Paul Cotton):</strong> A powerful opener, showcasing Cotton’s rhythmic guitar work and providing a dynamic, road-ready sound. It serves as an immediate reminder of the band’s prowess as a touring machine.</li>
    <li><strong>“That's What Love Is” (Rusty Young):</strong> Featuring Young on lead vocals and steel guitar, this track is a textbook example of Poco’s trademark mellow country sound. It's gentle, melodic, and highlights Young’s sensitivity as a songwriter.</li>
    <li><strong>“If You Can't Love This” (Paul Cotton):</strong> A rockier entry that speaks to Cotton’s consistent ability to push the band toward a slightly harder edge, providing necessary contrast to Young's country flair.</li>
    <li><strong>“I Can Only Imagine” (Rusty Young):</strong> While Poco is known for originals, Young's decision to cover the huge contemporary Christian hit by MercyMe proved inspired. He transformed the soaring ballad into a moving, steel-driven piece of Americana, demonstrating the versatility of the country rock genre.</li>
    <li><strong>“Never Loved at All” (Paul Cotton):</strong> This track stands out for its tight arrangement and the way Grantham’s drumming locks in with the bass, creating a solid, unshakable foundation for the guitar and steel leads to dance upon.</li>
</ul>

<p>The album successfully avoids sounding like a patchwork of individual efforts. Instead, it feels like the natural evolution of the sound the trio had established a quarter-century earlier. The songwriting duties are perfectly balanced, ensuring that both Rusty Young’s gentle, melodic touch and Paul Cotton’s sharper, more narrative style are fully represented.</p>

<h2>The Power of the Trio: Young, Cotton, and Grantham</h2>

<p>The magic of <em>Running Horse</em> lies squarely in the specific talents that define this particular Poco configuration. While many musicians have cycled through the lineup, the interplay between Young, Cotton, and Grantham is indelible.</p>

<p><strong>Rusty Young’s Steel Mastery:</strong> Young is, arguably, the most important figure in the history of the pedal steel guitar in rock music. His ability to use the instrument not just for ornamentation, but as a lead melodic voice, has influenced countless artists. On <em>Running Horse</em>, his playing is fluid and evocative, coloring every track with warmth and precision. His steel guitar work on tracks like “That's What Love Is” is quintessential Poco—clean, graceful, and emotionally resonant.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Cotton’s Songwriting and Guitar Work:</strong> Cotton provided the necessary grit and depth. While Young grounded the band in country, Cotton pulled them towards roots rock and blues. His guitar solos are economical and powerful, and his songwriting often tackled broader themes with a direct, conversational style. His presence on <em>Running Horse</em> ensures the album has a backbone of strong, assertive rock rhythm.</p>

<p><strong>George Grantham’s Foundation:</strong> As the original drummer of the classic lineup, Grantham’s return was crucial. His style is supportive, reliable, and perfectly suited to the complex harmonies and syncopated rhythms of country rock. His ability to lock down the grooves without overshadowing the detailed instrumentation provides the stable platform from which Young and Cotton can launch their sonic explorations. Grantham’s contribution ensured that the rhythm section felt authentic to the band’s roots.</p>

<h2>The Legacy and Critical Reception of *Running Horse*</h2>

<p>Upon its release, <em>Running Horse</em> was greeted with genuine enthusiasm from both critics and the dedicated Poco fan base. It was widely regarded as a return to form—an album that demonstrated that the country rock sound could age gracefully and remain relevant. Unlike some reunion albums that rely heavily on retreading old hits or mimicking past glories, <em>Running Horse</em> offered sophisticated, new compositions that felt vital.</p>

<p>The album stood in stark contrast to much of the mainstream country and rock music of the early 2000s, proving that timeless musicianship and authentic songwriting can cut through contemporary noise. For the fans who had followed Poco since their formative years, hearing Young, Cotton, and Grantham collaborating seamlessly on fresh material was a poignant and satisfying experience.</p>

<p><em>Running Horse</em> is more than just the eighteenth studio album by Poco; it is a historical document of an enduring musical partnership. It proved that sometimes, the best way forward for a band is to look back, not at their history, but at the genuine, irreplaceable chemistry shared between specific musicians. The album’s success underscored why this version of Poco was so beloved—they created music that was simultaneously complex, accessible, and deeply rooted in the American musical landscape.</p>

<p>The legacy of <em>Running Horse</em> confirms Poco’s place not just as pioneers of country rock, but as masterful musicians who could always reconnect with their core sound, even after decades apart. It is an essential listen for anyone seeking pure, unadulterated American music crafted by the masters of the genre.</p>
