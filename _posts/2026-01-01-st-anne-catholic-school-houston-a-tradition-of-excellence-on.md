Located in a central, highly accessible area of the city, St. Anne has served the community for decades, operating under the guidance and mission of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston.</p>

<p>This comprehensive overview dives deep into what makes St. Anne Catholic School a cornerstone of education and faith—from its highly strategic location and storied history to its robust K-8 curriculum and commitment to character development. Whether you are relocating to the Upper Kirby area or searching for a seamless transition from private elementary to middle school, understanding the mission and capabilities of St. Anne is essential.</p>

<h2>The Strategic Location: Westheimer Road and the Heart of Houston</h2>

<p>One of the defining practical advantages of St. Anne Catholic School is its prime location. The campus is situated at <strong>2120 Westheimer Road</strong>, precisely at the southeast corner of the busy and pivotal intersection of Westheimer and Shepherd. This placement is more than just convenient; it roots the school in the heart of some of Houston's most vibrant and sought-after neighborhoods.</p>

<p>For parents commuting or living nearby, the school's location offers unparalleled access to major thoroughfares, placing it directly between the energy of Montrose, the residential elegance of River Oaks, and the commercial hub of Upper Kirby. This proximity to central Houston ensures that students benefit not only from a strong campus environment but also from the educational and cultural resources of a major metropolitan area. Being part of the Westheimer corridor, <strong>St. Anne Catholic School Houston</strong> is truly integrated into the city's pulse, yet maintains the secure, focused atmosphere essential for primary education.</p>

<h2>A Rich History: Anchored by St. Anne Parish</h2>

<p>The history of the school is inextricably linked to St. Anne Catholic Church, which was founded decades ago to serve the growing Catholic population in this dynamic part of Houston. Parochial schools are essential components of their respective parishes, designed to provide comprehensive Catholic education that extends the mission of the Church into daily academic life. St. Anne Catholic School was established with the goal of creating lifelong learners grounded in Gospel values.</p>

<p>The dedication of the school staff, the support of the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston, and the strong parental involvement have allowed St. Anne to maintain its high standards across generations. This legacy ensures that when new families join the community, they are not just enrolling in a school; they are becoming part of a tradition that values academic rigor, service to others, and spiritual growth above all else. This enduring commitment to mission is a key differentiator for <strong>St. Anne Catholic School Houston</strong>.</p>
