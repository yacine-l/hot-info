<h2>The Unification Decree: Forging Franco’s Sole Party</h2>
<p>The history of 20th-century Spain is impossible to separate from the figure of Francisco Franco and the decades-long regime he established following the devastating Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). Crucial to maintaining his centralized, authoritarian control was the creation of a unified political instrument—a necessary step to subsume the disparate factions that had initially supported his military uprising.</p>

<p>This instrument was the <strong>Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista</strong>, mercifully abbreviated to <strong>FET y de las JONS</strong> (often simply referred to as ‘FET’). Born not from popular consensus but from military decree, FET y de las JONS served as the sole legal political organization in Spain from 1937 until Franco’s death in 1975. It was less a traditional political party and more a movement designed to mobilize support, administer social policy, and ensure absolute loyalty to the *Caudillo*.</p>

<p>The creation of FET marked one of the most significant power plays of the war era: the forced and often painful synthesis of two diametrically opposed right-wing ideologies—the revolutionary, modernist National Syndicalism of the original Falange, and the deeply traditional, monarchist integral Catholicism of the Carlist Traditionalist Communion. This uneasy marriage, orchestrated by Franco in 1937 via the *Decreto de Unificación*, provided him with the necessary political platform to transition his military dictatorship into a stable, long-term political system.</p>

<h2>The Genesis of FET: A Marriage of Necessity and Decree</h2>
<p>In the initial months of the Civil War, the Nationalist side was a chaotic coalition of regional armies, landowners, Catholics, monarchists, and fascistic youth movements. Two factions stood out due to their robust mobilization capabilities and distinct uniforms: the Blue Shirts (Falangists) and the Red Berets (Carlists). While both groups supported the overthrow of the Republic, they held fundamentally different views on the future structure of Spain.</p>

<p>The rivalry between these groups was often violent, with street fights and assassinations common even within the Nationalist zone. Franco, realizing that internal division threatened the war effort and, more importantly, challenged his own supremacy, determined that these forces had to be brought to heel. On April 19, 1937, Franco issued the *Decreto de Unificación*.</p>

<p>This decree mandated the immediate merger of the <strong>Falange Española de las JONS</strong> and the <strong>Traditionalist Communion (Comunión Tradicionalista)</strong> into the single state party: FET y de las JONS. By dictating this unification, Franco ensured that any potential political opposition, whether from the radical revolutionary left of the Falange or the deeply entrenched monarchist right of the Carlists, was simultaneously neutralized and co-opted. The Generalissimo immediately named himself the *Jefe Nacional* (National Chief), guaranteeing that the party served as an administrative appendage of the military regime, rather than an independent political engine.</p>

<h2>The Ideological Conflict: Blue Shirts vs. Red Berets</h2>
<p>The inherent tension within FET y de las JONS stemmed from the incompatible ideological blueprints of its constituent parts. Understanding these differences is key to grasping the often-contradictory nature of Francoism itself.</p>

<h3>The National Syndicalist Core: Falange Española de las JONS</h3>
<p>The original Falange, founded largely by José Antonio Primo de Rivera, was inspired by European fascism and Italian corporatism. It was a youthful, revolutionary movement dedicated to dismantling both capitalism and Marxism. Its core principles revolved around National Syndicalism:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Economic Revolution:</strong> Advocating for a third way, where the state organized the economy through vertical syndicates, effectively merging workers and employers under state control.</li>
    <li><strong>Imperial Ambition:</strong> A nostalgic desire to restore Spain’s historical greatness and territorial influence.</li>
    <li><strong>Secular Nationalism:</strong> While respecting Catholicism, the original Falange emphasized the primacy of the State over the Church, a highly modern view that clashed with Spain’s traditional Catholic foundations.</li>
</ul>
<p>When FET was formed, Franco symbolically retained much of the platform and structure of the Falange, including its revolutionary rhetoric and aesthetic (the blue shirts, the yoke and arrows emblem, and the anthem "Cara al Sol"). This provided the regime with a veneer of radical dynamism and mass appeal, particularly among urban youth.</p>

<h3>The Traditionalist Anchor: The Carlist Communion</h3>
<p>The Carlists, the other half of the merger, represented the antithesis of revolutionary politics. Rooted in 19th-century dynastic wars, they were ultra-traditionalist, deeply pious, and fiercely devoted to a specific, absolutist branch of the Bourbon monarchy. Their ideological demands included:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Integral Catholicism:</strong> The insistence that the Spanish state must be fundamentally Catholic and governed strictly by Catholic doctrine (a concept known as *integrismo*).</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimist Monarchy:</strong> Opposition to the liberal monarchy established in the 19th century and support for their own royal claimant.</li>
    <li><strong>Regional Charters (Fueros):</strong> Support for traditional, local autonomies defined by historical rights, as opposed to centralized, modern state control.</li>
</ul>
<p>The inclusion of the Carlists provided the Franco regime with legitimacy among the deeply conservative rural population, the Church, and the traditional Spanish elite. However, the Red Berets often felt betrayed by the unification, viewing Franco’s creation of FET as a hijacking of their movement in the service of a military dictator, rather than the restoration of a legitimate Catholic monarchy.</p>

<h2>The Platform of FET y de las JONS: A Nationalist Synthesis</h2>
<p>The resulting ideology of FET was a pragmatic, often contradictory mix, dictated by the needs of the Francoist State rather than true philosophical coherence. The official doctrine of the new party had to incorporate elements of the original Falange’s *27 Points* while sanitizing them to align with conservative Catholic social teaching.</p>

<p>Revolutionary demands for radical syndicalism were moderated into a bureaucratic Corporatism, while the secular nationalism of the original Falange was saturated with Carlist-style integral Catholicism. This hybrid ideology became known as <strong>National Catholicism (Nacionalcatolicismo)</strong>, the bedrock of the Francoist State.</p>

<p>As the sole legal entity, FET y de las JONS became the primary vehicle for political participation, though this participation was strictly non-competitive. Its functions extended far beyond traditional political organization:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bureaucratic Control:</strong> Party membership was often a prerequisite for employment in the civil service or military promotion.</li>
    <li><strong>Labor Organization:</strong> It oversaw the state-controlled vertical syndicates (Sindicatos Verticales), ensuring labor disputes were managed by the state.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Assistance:</strong> Through its ancillary organizations, such as the Women’s Section (*Sección Femenina*), the party managed vast social welfare, educational, and ideological indoctrination programs.</li>
    <li><strong>Personnel Recruitment:</strong> It served as the central clearinghouse for recruiting and training the political elite who governed the provinces and ministries.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, FET y de las JONS was not tasked with making policy; it was tasked with implementing, celebrating, and enforcing the decrees issued by Franco and his appointed cabinet.</p>

<h2>The Evolution of FET in Post-War Spain</h2>
<p>In the decades following the Civil War, the character of FET y de las JONS evolved significantly. While it remained the mandatory political expression of the nation, its initial revolutionary fervor quickly faded, replaced by bureaucratic inertia and traditional conservatism.</p>

<p>Franco expertly played the two main factions—the *Falangists* (advocating for the party's primacy and social revolution) and the *Traditionalists/Monarchists* (advocating for the eventual restoration of the monarchy and deep conservatism)—against each other. By maintaining this internal dynamic, Franco ensured no single faction within FET could grow powerful enough to challenge his personal authority.</p>

<p>As Spain opened economically in the 1950s and 1960s (a period known as the Spanish Miracle), the technocrats, often associated with the Catholic lay organization Opus Dei, began to gain ascendancy in government cabinets. This shift diluted the power of the old-guard Falangists, who increasingly saw their influence restricted to propaganda and state syndicates, while true governmental policy was guided by economic modernizers.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, FET y de las JONS remained the official foundation of the regime, the mechanism by which the state ensured ideological homogeneity and provided the necessary framework for its institutional laws, known as the Fundamental Laws of the Realm.</p>

<h2>Legacy and Dissolution</h2>
<p>The existence of the FET y de las JONS was intrinsically linked to the life of General Franco. When Franco died in November 1975, the political foundation of the single-party state collapsed. The party’s decline was swift, as the political transition to democracy (the *Transición Española*) began under King Juan Carlos I.</p>

<p>Though various splinter groups tried to maintain the name and ideology, the unified FET y de las JONS was formally dissolved shortly after. Today, the party is studied as a unique example of a state-controlled, mandatory political movement that successfully synthesized contradictory political traditions into an instrument of personal authoritarian rule—a central, if often contradictory, pillar of 39 years of Spanish history.</p>
