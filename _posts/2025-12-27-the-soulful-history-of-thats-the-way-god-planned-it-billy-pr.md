## The Fifth Beatle and the Genesis of a Masterpiece

In the tumultuous year of 1969, as the idealism of the 1960s began to splinter and the world of rock music sought new frontiers, a pivotal album emerged that seamlessly fused the raw intensity of gospel, the precision of British rock, and the heartfelt depth of American soul. That album was *That's The Way God Planned It*, the fourth studio effort by the prodigious keyboardist, Billy Preston.

Released in August 1969 on The Beatles’ fledgling label, Apple Records, this LP was far more than just another studio recording; it was a testament to the powerful collaborative spirit brewing across the Atlantic. At the heart of this project was a bond forged just months earlier, when Preston famously sat in with The Beatles during their fraught *Get Back* (later *Let It Be*) sessions. This connection not only resulted in Preston receiving a unique co-credit on the "Get Back" single—a rare feat in Beatles history—but also guaranteed him the unprecedented artistic support of George Harrison, who stepped into the producer’s chair for *That's The Way God Planned It*.

The album stands as a crucial waypoint in music history, showcasing Preston’s immense talent not just as a sideman, but as a compelling songwriter and vocalist in his own right. For fans seeking the definitive work that launched Preston into solo stardom, understanding the context, the collaborators, and the spiritual inspiration behind **Billy Preston That's the Way God Planned It** is essential.

## The Context of Collaboration: Billy Preston and The Beatles

Billy Preston’s arrival in London in early 1969 was serendipitous, marking a period of intense creative and personal friction within The Beatles. The sessions intended to create a new, live-focused album had descended into arguments and apathy. Recognizing the need for a stabilizing presence, George Harrison invited Preston, whom he had known since 1962 when Preston toured with Little Richard.

Preston, bringing an unparalleled professionalism and joyful spirit, instantly alleviated the tension. The Beatles, unable to argue openly in front of an outsider, found a renewed focus, resulting in the eventual release of the iconic single “Get Back.” This highly fruitful period led Harrison and The Beatles to sign Preston to Apple Records, the label intended to foster unique and innovative talent.

The decision to pair Preston with Harrison as producer was a natural fit. Harrison, increasingly drawn to philosophical and spiritual themes in his own work, found a kindred spirit in Preston, whose musical roots lay deep in the gospel church. Harrison saw the potential to craft an album that wasn't just technically brilliant, but emotionally and spiritually resonant.

The recording of **Billy Preston That's the Way God Planned It** became a passion project for Harrison, allowing him to explore production styles outside the suffocating shadow of The Beatles' internal politics. It provided the framework for an album that transcended genre boundaries, blending Preston’s fiery organ work and soulful vocals with the burgeoning sound of late-60s British rock.

## George Harrison: From Fan to Producer

Harrison’s involvement in *That's The Way God Planned It* was total. Unlike some other early Apple releases that suffered from corporate neglect or poor management, Harrison ensured this album received meticulous attention. His production philosophy centered on capturing the raw, live energy that Preston brought to every performance, avoiding the over-dubbing heavy approach characteristic of many late 60s albums.

Harrison understood that Preston’s magic lay in the intensity of his Hammond B3 organ work and the spontaneity of his vocal delivery. He employed recording techniques aimed at creating a clean, powerful soundscape where Preston’s musicianship was the undeniable centerpiece.

Key aspects of Harrison’s production on the album include:

*   **Emphasis on Live Takes:** The foundational tracks often sound raw and immediate, reflective of Harrison’s desire to capture the energy of the session players performing together in the studio.
*   **Spiritual Resonance:** Harrison helped guide the thematic focus, aligning the lyrics with a broader message of faith and destiny, most evident in the soaring title track.
*   **The Right Supporting Cast:** Perhaps Harrison’s most crucial contribution was assembling an unbelievable roster of musicians—a group that would later be referenced by many as the precursors to supergroups like Derek and the Dominos.

Harrison’s work on **Billy Preston That's the Way God Planned It** laid the groundwork for his highly successful solo production career in the 1970s, proving his capability to manage diverse, high-caliber talent while maintaining artistic vision.

## The All-Star Sessions: Rock Royalty Meets Soul

One of the defining features of *That's The Way God Planned It* is the incredible lineup of musicians Harrison managed to gather. The backing band reads like a who’s who of late 1960s British rock aristocracy, demonstrating the immense respect they held for both Harrison and Preston.

The sessions featured:

*   **Keith Richards (The Rolling Stones):** Providing his distinctive, gritty rhythm guitar, bringing a bluesy counterpoint to Preston’s soul structures.
*   **Eric Clapton (Blind Faith/Cream):** Delivering fiery lead guitar work, particularly noticeable on the more extended instrumental passages.
*   **Ginger Baker (Cream/Blind Faith):** Supplying his bombastic, jazz-inflected drumming, adding depth and complexity to the rhythm section.
*   **Klaus Voormann:** A frequent Harrison collaborator and designer of The Beatles' *Revolver* cover, holding down the bassline.
*   **Doris Troy:** The legendary American gospel singer, who provided powerful backing vocals, ensuring the gospel roots of the title track remained strong.

The sheer synergy of these seemingly disparate talents—the disciplined rock and roll of Richards, the improvisational blues of Clapton, and the church-trained soul of Preston—resulted in a sound that was truly revolutionary. It was a successful experiment in cross-pollination, proving that soul music could be amplified and energized by the power of rock instrumentation without losing its emotional core.

The involvement of such high-profile artists solidified the status of **Billy Preston That's the Way God Planned It** not just as a soul album, but as an essential piece of British rock history, capturing a specific moment in time when the greatest musicians in the world were eager to collaborate and redefine the boundaries of their respective genres.

## Deconstructing the Masterpiece: Track Highlights

While the entire album is a showcase for Preston’s versatility, it is undoubtedly the iconic title track that cemented its place in music history.

### "That's The Way God Planned It"

The lead single and centerpiece of the album, “That’s The Way God Planned It,” is a gospel-rock epic that builds from a quiet, reverent beginning into a cathartic, shouting finale. The track is built around Preston’s vocal improvisation and organ arpeggios, backed by the full power of the assembled rock legends. The song’s thematic content—surrender to fate and divine will—resonated deeply with the spiritual inclinations of both Harrison and Preston. When released as a single, it became a massive hit in the UK, propelling Preston into the international spotlight.

### Other Standout Tracks

The album is far from a one-hit wonder. It offers a diverse exploration of soul, blues, and instrumental brilliance:

*   **"Do What You Want":** An up-tempo, joyful track that captures the celebratory atmosphere of the sessions. It showcases Preston’s abilities as a dynamic front man, combining catchy R&B grooves with his signature keyboard flair.
*   **"Use What You Got":** A slow, blues-infused track that allows Eric Clapton’s guitar work to shine through the mix. This song demonstrates the successful integration of heavy blues rock into Preston’s soul framework.
*   **"I Want To Thank You":** A testament to Preston’s powerful ballad singing, featuring lush, orchestral-style accompaniment that provides a moment of tenderness amidst the rock intensity.
*   **Instrumental Prowess:** Several tracks emphasize the deep musicianship, often giving Preston room to stretch out on the organ and electric piano, proving his mastery over both gospel and jazz idioms.

The overall sound of **Billy Preston That's the Way God Planned It** is cohesive, marked by a sense of hope and exhilaration. It perfectly captures the energy of the time and the unique opportunity afforded by the limitless artistic freedom of early Apple Records.

## The Enduring Legacy on Apple Records

While Apple Records is primarily remembered for the output of The Beatles, it served as a crucial platform for diverse talent. *That's The Way God Planned It* remains one of the label’s most critically acclaimed non-Beatle releases.

The success of the album and the title track single proved that Billy Preston was not merely a hired session musician, but a major solo artist capable of driving a global hit. The album set the stage for Preston’s remarkable career trajectory in the 1970s, where he would go on to achieve massive mainstream success with hits like "Will It Go Round in Circles" and "Nothing from Nothing."

Today, the album serves as a vital historical document. It captures George Harrison’s maturation as a producer, the fluidity of the British rock scene when genre lines blurred, and, most importantly, the undeniable genius of Billy Preston. For anyone exploring the intersection of soul, gospel, and rock, **Billy Preston That's the Way God Planned It** is an essential and eternally rewarding listen.
