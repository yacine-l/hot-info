<h2>The Andrew Hill Paradox: Genius Delayed, Never Denied</h2>
    
    <p>Andrew Hill (1931–2007) holds a singular place in the history of American jazz. He was a composer of immense depth and a pianist whose rhythmic approach defied categorization. While contemporaries often sought melodic purity or pure speed, Hill built sonic architectures—complex, asymmetrical, and deeply philosophical. He was the intellectual architect of the mid-1960s avant-garde movement at Blue Note Records, crafting albums like *Point of Departure* and *Judgment!* that stand as cornerstones of the era.</p>
    
    <p>Yet, Hill’s prolific output and demanding artistic vision often outpaced the commercial realities of the jazz industry. No album exemplifies this paradox better than <em>Change</em>. Recorded in 1966, at the very peak of his compositional powers, <em>Change</em> was a completed masterpiece slated for release as BST 84233. Instead of hitting the shelves in 1967, the album vanished. It spent nearly three decades in the Blue Note vaults, becoming one of the most significant and perplexing archival oversights in jazz history.</p>
    
    <p>This article delves into the convoluted journey of <em>Change</em>, analyzing the profound music within, the phenomenal quartet responsible for its creation, and the reasons why its eventual rediscovery was a major corrective action in the history of 20th-century music.</p>
    
    <h2>1966: The Peak of Blue Note’s Avant-Garde Era</h2>
    
    <p>The year 1966 was pivotal for Blue Note. Under the guidance of producer Alfred Lion and engineer Rudy Van Gelder, the label was pushing the boundaries of hard bop into territories informed by free jazz and abstract composition. Andrew Hill was arguably the central figure in this transition, mastering the balance between structural integrity and improvisational freedom.</p>
    
    <p>On May 12, 1966, Hill gathered a superb quartet for the session that would become <em>Change</em>. The recordings captured six challenging, deeply felt originals. Musically, the album represented a synthesis of the modal intensity of the early 1960s and the increasingly abstract structural experiments that defined the new wave of jazz. Hill managed to sound completely modern without abandoning melody entirely, creating a tension that gives the album its enduring power.</p>
    
    <h3>The Quartet: A Study in Dynamic Synergy</h3>
    
    <p>The success of <em>Change</em> is inextricably linked to the unparalleled communication between the four musicians involved. This was a group handpicked for their ability to navigate Hill’s often labyrinthine structures:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Andrew Hill (Piano/Composer):</strong> The guiding light, dictating complex changes and providing a percussive, yet lyrical, foundation.</li>
        <li><strong>Sam Rivers (Tenor Saxophone):</strong> The perfect foil for Hill. Rivers possessed an encyclopedic knowledge of jazz history but was fearless in his exploration of atonality and texture. His solos here are searing and highly disciplined, pushing the music to its breaking point without ever losing the plot.</li>
        <li><strong>Walter Booker (Bass):</strong> Known for his strong, grounding presence, Booker provided the necessary anchor for Hill’s rhythmic deviations and Moses’ explosive drumming.</li>
        <li><strong>J.C. Moses (Drums):</strong> A tragically underrated powerhouse, Moses’ drumming is not merely accompaniment; it is an active compositional element. He responds to Hill’s phrases with sudden, asymmetrical accents, driving the music forward in unexpected bursts.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The dialogue between Hill and Rivers is particularly stunning. Rivers treats Hill’s compositions not as mere chord charts, but as philosophical launching pads, executing extended solos that demonstrate both technical brilliance and deep emotional commitment.</p>
    
    <h2>The Mystery of the Shelved Masterpiece</h2>
    
    <p>The question that plagues collectors and historians is simple: Why was <em>Change</em>, a fully recorded and mastered session featuring top-tier talent, withheld? The answer is complex, rooted in the changing infrastructure of Blue Note Records.</p>
    
    <p>In 1965, Liberty Records acquired Blue Note. While Alfred Lion and Francis Wolff initially maintained artistic control, the corporate shift brought about new priorities, often favoring more commercially accessible titles. Many of the most challenging and avant-garde sessions recorded in the mid-sixties, including works by Jackie McLean and Larry Young, suffered delays or were outright shelved.</p>
    
    <p><em>Change</em> was one of the prime casualties. Despite being assigned a catalog number (BST 84233), the tapes sat dormant. For years, the only evidence of this session’s existence was in dusty label archives.</p>
    
    <h3>The First Appearance: Involution (1975)</h3>
    
    <p>When the music finally saw the light of day in 1975, it was not as Andrew Hill’s dedicated album. Instead, the tracks were combined with other unreleased Blue Note material featuring Sam Rivers, and packaged as a double-LP compilation titled <em>Involution</em>. Crucially, the material was credited under Sam Rivers’ leadership.</p>
    
    <p>While jazz aficionados recognized the distinct compositional stamp of Andrew Hill, the album’s true identity remained obscured. <em>Involution</em> was a significant historical document, but it failed to give Hill the proper credit or context for his creative achievements. It confirmed the existence of the 1966 sessions, but did not fully restore their integrity as a unified artistic statement.</p>
    
    <h2>The Restoration: Andrew Hill’s Canonical Status Reaffirmed</h2>
    
    <p>The true rescue of <em>Change</em> occurred over two decades later, championed by dedicated historians and archivists. The pivotal moment arrived in 1995 with the release of the massive Mosaic Records box set, <em>The Complete Blue Note Andrew Hill Sessions (1963-66)</em>.</p>
    
    <p>Mosaic specializes in definitive, limited-edition reissues, and this set meticulously collected all of Hill’s sessions for the label, organizing them chronologically and correctly attributing leadership. For the first time, the six tracks from the 1966 date were presented under Andrew Hill’s name, allowing listeners to hear the session as the unified artistic statement it was intended to be. This box set was a major critical success, finally solidifying Hill’s status as a canonical Blue Note master.</p>
    
    <p>It wasn't until the mainstream CD era that <em>Change</em> was released as a standalone album under Hill’s name, enabling its widespread accessibility and allowing it to take its proper place alongside classics like <em>Black Fire</em>.</p>
    
    <h2>Deconstructing the Compositions of Change</h2>
    
    <p>The six original compositions on <em>Change</em> demonstrate Hill’s commitment to dense rhythmic layers and melodic fragments that coalesce into powerful, often unsettling narratives. These pieces demand active listening, revealing new details with every spin.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Tracks and Compositional Elements:</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>“Change”:</strong> The title track is an immediate declaration of intent. It features intricate unison lines between piano and saxophone, built around a shifting harmonic center. The mood is taut, embodying the conceptual "change" in jazz structure occurring in the mid-sixties.</li>
        <li><strong>“Symmetry”:</strong> Despite the title, this piece is characterized by rhythmic asymmetry. It is a showcase for Moses’ unique, fragmented drumming style and Hill’s ability to create a sense of forward momentum using angular phrasing.</li>
        <li><strong>“Violence”:</strong> Arguably the most intense composition on the album. “Violence” explores dissonance and high-energy improvisation. The original 2007 CD reissue famously included the shorter, initially preferred take of this piece, alongside the longer, more sprawling alternate take, offering fascinating insight into the production choices of the era.</li>
        <li><strong>“A Streetcar Named Desire”:</strong> Not a cover of the movie theme, but a Hill original capturing a sense of dramatic, film-noir tension. It’s modal and moody, allowing Rivers to delve into the lower registers of the tenor.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Hill’s ability to imbue complex musical mathematics with deep emotion is the album’s greatest triumph. He never sacrifices feeling for intellectualism; instead, the intellect serves the feeling.</p>
    
    <h2>The Enduring Significance of the 2007 Reissue</h2>
    
    <p>When Blue Note released <em>Change</em> as a stand-alone CD in 2007, they provided an added layer of scholarly depth. Two alternate takes were included, significantly enriching the listening experience.</p>
    
    <p>The inclusion of multiple takes of compositions like “Violence” allowed listeners to witness the compositional process in real-time. Jazz sessions in the 1960s were often spontaneous, and musicians rarely played a piece the same way twice. Hearing the subtle, yet crucial, differences in melodic development and rhythmic emphasis across the takes underscores the collective genius of the quartet and the fluid nature of Hill’s structures.</p>
    
    <p>The 2007 release secured <em>Change</em> its place, finally, as a dedicated entry in the Andrew Hill discography, decades after its intended issue. This re-contextualization was essential, transforming it from a historical footnote in a Rivers compilation into a recognized Andrew Hill masterwork.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion: A Lost Masterpiece Found</h2>
    
    <p>The story of Andrew Hill’s <em>Change</em> is a powerful reminder that artistic merit does not always correlate with immediate commercial success or prompt release. Its decades-long hiatus from public view only enhanced its mystique, turning it into the epitome of the “lost Blue Note session.”</p>
    
    <p>Today, <em>Change</em> stands as an essential document of 1960s avant-garde jazz. It is a stunning display of compositional genius, featuring six Hill originals that explore the outer limits of rhythm and harmony, anchored by one of the most cohesive and fearless quartets of the era. The album's complicated journey—from 1966 session to 1975 compilation credit and, finally, to 1995 and 2007 canonical releases—serves as a testament to the enduring power of music that is simply too profound to remain hidden.</p>
    
    <p>For collectors and serious listeners, *Change* is not just an album; it is a historical victory—the sound of genius emerging, finally, from the shadows of the vault.</p>
