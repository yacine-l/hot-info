<h2>The Unsung Workhorse: Detailing the Brief but Vital Service of the USS Alexander H. Erickson (SP-2298)</h2>

<p>When historians recount the great naval campaigns of World War I, the narrative often centers on dreadnoughts, U-boats, and the dramatic convoys crossing the treacherous Atlantic. Yet, the victory hinged equally on a vast, often overlooked fleet of auxiliary vessels—small ships, often privately owned and quickly requisitioned, that ensured the great fighting ships were fueled, provisioned, and moved efficiently through crowded harbors. One such vessel, whose service was brief, demanding, and largely undocumented, was the <strong>USS Alexander H. Erickson (SP-2298)</strong>.</p>

<p>The story of the <em>Alexander H. Erickson</em> is a perfect microcosm of the U.S. Navy’s massive, hurried logistical expansion during the Great War. It represents the hundreds of civilian ships pulled into the Naval Auxiliary Service, sacrificing their commercial roles to support the war effort, only to be promptly returned to their owners once the immediate crisis had passed. While her tenure under the Stars and Stripes lasted just over 17 months, the duty of this powerful harbor tug was indispensable to the crucial logistical pipeline flowing through the Atlantic coast.</p>

<h2>From Commercial Service to Wartime Necessity: The Birth of a Naval Auxiliary</h2>

<p>The <strong>USS Alexander H. Erickson</strong> began its life far from the theaters of war, designed for the rough-and-tumble demands of civilian maritime commerce. Built in 1917, she was a relatively new vessel when the U.S. entered the conflict. Her origins point to the specific needs of the bustling New York harbor:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Builder:</strong> Hahn and Miller</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> New Baltimore, New York</li>
<li><strong>Original Owner:</strong> The Olsen Water and Towing Co., of New York City</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Harbor Tug</li>
</ul>

<p>Harbor tugs are the unseen muscle of any major port. They guide massive freighters, maneuver delicate destroyers, and, most importantly, manage the constant flow of coal and supply barges. As the United States rapidly mobilized its Navy following the 1917 declaration of war, the need for these specialized workhorses skyrocketed. The Navy, lacking sufficient assets of its own, implemented a widespread program of requisitioning commercial vessels, identifying them under the "Section Patrol" (SP) classification—hence, the designation <strong>SP-2298</strong>.</p>

<p>The transition from private ownership to military service was swift, demonstrating the wartime urgency. Naval authorities in the 3rd Naval District—which covered the vital maritime region around New York City—inspected the <em>Erickson</em> on 4 February 1918. The inspection deemed the tug fit for naval duty, and she was officially reported as taken over by the Navy on 9 March 1918.</p>

<h2>The 3rd Naval District: Mobilization Hub and Staging Point</h2>

<p>The initial acquisition of the <strong>Alexander H. Erickson</strong> within the 3rd Naval District was strategic. The 3rd ND was the primary staging area for the movement of men, matériel, and ships across the Atlantic. From New York, convoys were assembled, repaired, and sent east. This necessitated an immense local support structure.</p>

<p>The decision to requisition a tug like the <em>Alexander H. Erickson</em> underscored the challenges the Navy faced:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Congestion Management:</strong> New York Harbor was exponentially more crowded during the war, filled with transports and warships. Tugs were essential for preventing bottlenecks.</li>
<li><strong>Draft Management:</strong> Many newly launched or refitted naval vessels required assistance navigating the narrow channels and docks.</li>
<li><strong>The SP System:</strong> The SP identification number was a simple administrative way to track the thousands of motorboats, yachts, and commercial vessels suddenly pressed into service for patrol and auxiliary duties.</li>
</ol>

<p>While the <em>Erickson</em> was acquired and placed under the command of the 3rd Naval District initially, her destiny lay further south, pointing to a critical logistical need that transcended the mobilization duties of New York.</p>

<h2>The Quiet Duty: Norfolk and the Engine of Naval Logistics</h2>

<p>Despite being acquired in New York, sources indicate that the ultimate and most important duty station for the <strong>USS Alexander H. Erickson (SP-2298)</strong> was Norfolk, Virginia. This transfer of duty placed her directly into the heart of the U.S. Navy’s logistical machinery in the South Atlantic.</p>

<p>The primary role of the <em>Erickson</em> was simple, yet foundational to the entire war effort: to handle barges at Norfolk, VA. This seemingly mundane task was, in reality, crucial. Norfolk was a major hub for coal, ammunition, and provisions destined for the fleet and for transport ships heading overseas. The smooth and rapid movement of barges carrying millions of tons of supplies was essential to maintain the deployment cycle of the fighting fleet.</p>

<p>Harbor tugs performing this duty operated around the clock, in all weather conditions, navigating tight spaces and often dangerous currents while pushing heavy loads of coal or explosives. Their lack of detailed operational logs, a common issue for smaller auxiliary ships, speaks volumes about the nature of their service—it was routine, relentless, and considered a supporting background function, even though failure in this area would cripple major naval operations.</p>

<h3>The Challenge of Documenting the Service</h3>

<p>One of the most defining and frustrating aspects of the <strong>USS Alexander H. Erickson’s</strong> naval career is the scarcity of documentation. The official summary notes that her operations “are not reflected in any logs.” This lack of detailed record is typical for ships assigned to local harbor duties. Unlike ships engaged in transatlantic convoy duty or combat patrols, whose activities generated extensive reports, the harbor tug was considered part of the permanent infrastructure of the base.</p>

<p>This absence of detailed logs means that the specific movements, commanders, and daily challenges faced by the crew of the <em>Erickson</em> are lost to history. What remains clear is that for over a year and a half, she provided essential support to the 5th Naval District, ensuring the operational readiness of the battleships, cruisers, and destroyers basing out of Norfolk and Hampton Roads.</p>

<h2>Post-War Drawdown and the Rapid Return to Civilian Life</h2>

<p>The true brevity of the <strong>USS Alexander H. Erickson’s</strong> service is highlighted by the speed of her return to civilian life following the Armistice in November 1918. While the war had ended, the Navy maintained a high level of logistical readiness for several months during the demobilization process.</p>

<p>The <em>Erickson</em> was officially transferred from the 3rd Naval District (New York’s jurisdiction) to the 5th Naval District (Norfolk’s jurisdiction) on 20 August 1919. This transfer appears to have been an administrative update, formalizing her extended duty at the Norfolk base.</p>

<p>However, her official time in the 5th Naval District was staggeringly short—only eight days. The post-war mission to reduce the Navy’s auxiliary fleet and return requisitioned vessels to their commercial owners was moving quickly by mid-1919. The Navy had thousands of vessels acquired under the SP system, and returning them freed up naval personnel and reduced operational costs.</p>

<p>The timeline of her release demonstrates this rapid pace:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>20 August 1919:</strong> Recorded as transferred to the 5th Naval District.</li>
<li><strong>28 August 1919:</strong> Returned to her original owner, the Olsen Water and Towing Co.</li>
<li><strong>28 August 1919:</strong> Her name was officially struck from the Navy list.</li>
</ul>

<p>In less than a week and a half, the naval career of the <strong>USS Alexander H. Erickson (SP-2298)</strong> was over. She reverted back to being a commercial asset, ready to resume the demanding, yet less documented, work of maintaining the flow of goods through New York Harbor.</p>

<h2>The Lasting Importance of the Harbor Tug</h2>

<p>The story of the <strong>USS Alexander H. Erickson</strong> is not one of wartime glory or heroic confrontation; it is a story of reliability, necessity, and the immense power of supporting logistics. The fact that the Navy needed a brand-new, powerful tug built by Hahn and Miller and operated by Olsen Water and Towing Co. speaks to the irreplaceable utility of these vessels.</p>

<p>Without the tireless work of ships like the <em>Erickson</em>, the great naval bases like Norfolk would have ground to a halt. Tugs ensured that coal reached the bunker ships, that supplies were unloaded and distributed, and that the massive warships could safely navigate the harbor—a logistical ballet often performed under intense pressure and stress.</p>

<p>The <strong>SP-2298</strong> classification might have afforded the <em>Alexander H. Erickson</em> a brief entry in naval history books, but her true contribution was measured not in miles sailed or enemies engaged, but in tons of cargo moved and the hours saved in the critical supply chain of a nation at war. Though her logs may be empty, her dedication to the vital, unglamorous duties of naval logistics secures her place among the silent heroes of the First World War fleet.</p>
