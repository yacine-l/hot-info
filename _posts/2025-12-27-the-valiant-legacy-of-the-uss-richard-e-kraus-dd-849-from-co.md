<p>The history of the United States Navy is a mosaic of heroism, technological innovation, and dedicated service. Few vessels embody this blend quite as distinctly as the <strong>USS Richard E. Kraus (DD-849)</strong>. A formidable Gearing-class destroyer, the DD-849 was born out of the demands of the Second World War but spent its entire active career navigating the tense complexities of the Cold War. Her unique story is defined not just by the vigilance typical of her class, but by a remarkable transformation late in her service life, transitioning from a frontline combatant to a crucial experimental platform (AG-151).</p>

<p>This vessel carried more than just armament; she carried a legacy. Named for Marine Private First Class Richard E. Kraus, the ship served as a constant reminder of the extreme courage demonstrated by one Marine during the brutal Pacific campaign. The ship’s operational history—from Atlantic patrol and Mediterranean deployments to pioneering naval research—ensured that the name <strong>USS Richard E. Kraus</strong> remained synonymous with duty and innovation.</p>

<p>This article dives deep into the life of DD-849, exploring the hero who inspired her name, her critical role during the decades of global tension, and her specialized final years as a test ship that helped pave the way for modern naval technology.</p>

<h2>The Namesake: A Hero of Peleliu and the Medal of Honor</h2>

<p>To understand the spirit of the <strong>USS Richard E. Kraus</strong>, one must first recognize the sacrifice of the man she honored. Private First Class Richard E. Kraus (1925–1944) was a young Marine serving with the 8th Service Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, during one of the Pacific theater’s most ferocious battles: the Battle of Peleliu in September 1944.</p>

<p>PFC Kraus’s actions on September 30, 1944, epitomize the bravery often required in close-quarters combat. While serving as a scout for his company, his platoon came under sudden, devastating attack from hidden Japanese machine guns. Recognizing the immense danger to his comrades, Kraus acted immediately.</p>

<p>He single-handedly charged the enemy position, drawing the relentless fire onto himself. Though mortally wounded by a grenade, his courageous diversion allowed his fellow Marines to reorganize, gain cover, and ultimately destroy the enemy strongpoint. For his "conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life," PFC Richard E. Kraus was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor—the nation’s highest military decoration.</p>

<p>The decision to name a fast destroyer after an enlisted Marine Medal of Honor recipient provided the crew of the <strong>DD-849</strong> with a tangible connection to the corps’ storied heritage and set a precedent for valor that permeated the ship’s subsequent service years.</p>

<h2>Birth of a Gearing-Class Destroyer (DD-849)</h2>

<p>The <strong>USS Richard E. Kraus</strong> was laid down in 1945 at the Bath Iron Works, Maine. She was part of the final, most advanced evolution of the US Navy’s conventional destroyers: the Gearing class. Though commissioned too late to see action in World War II—she was launched in March 1946—her design was perfected by the lessons learned in the war at sea.</p>

<p>Gearing-class destroyers were essentially lengthened versions of the successful Allen M. Sumner class, providing greater fuel capacity and improved range, making them ideal for long-duration patrol and escort duties necessary in a newly polarized world. The <strong>DD-849</strong> was designed for speed, versatility, and heavy firepower.</p>

<p>Key initial specifications of the <strong>Gearing-class destroyer</strong> included:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Displacement:</strong> Approximately 2,616 tons (full load).</li>
    <li><strong>Armament (Initial):</strong> Six 5-inch/38 caliber guns in three twin mounts, torpedo tubes, and anti-submarine weaponry.</li>
    <li><strong>Propulsion:</strong> High-pressure steam turbines providing speeds in excess of 35 knots.</li>
    <li><strong>Role:</strong> Anti-Air Warfare (AAW), Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW), and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW).</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon commissioning in May 1946, the <strong>USS Richard E. Kraus</strong> joined the Atlantic Fleet, immediately diving into the demanding schedule of training exercises, fleet readiness patrols, and the geopolitical chess match of the early Cold War.</p>

<h2>Post-War Service and the Cold War Patrols</h2>

<p>The bulk of the <strong>USS Richard E. Kraus’s</strong> career was spent in the Atlantic and Mediterranean theaters, supporting NATO operations and safeguarding US interests in volatile regions. She quickly established herself as a reliable component of Destroyer Division 282, based initially in Norfolk, Virginia.</p>

<p>During the 1950s, the ship regularly participated in "Med Cruises," lengthy deployments to the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. These deployments were crucial for projecting American power and maintaining stability in areas where Soviet influence was aggressively expanding. The <strong>DD-849</strong> conducted surveillance, escorted aircraft carriers, and participated in joint exercises with Allied navies.</p>

<h3>The FRAM Modernization Program</h3>

<p>By the late 1950s, the emergence of fast, quiet Soviet submarines rendered many existing destroyers’ ASW capabilities obsolete. To address this, the Navy initiated the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) program. The <strong>USS Richard E. Kraus</strong> received her crucial FRAM I upgrade in the early 1960s, dramatically enhancing her effectiveness against the new submarine threat.</p>

<p>The FRAM I upgrade transformed the Gearing class:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Enhanced ASW Capability:</strong> Replacement of older torpedo tubes with the ASROC (Anti-Submarine Rocket) launcher.</li>
    <li><strong>New Detection Systems:</strong> Installation of improved sonar and communications equipment.</li>
    <li><strong>Hangar Facilities:</strong> Addition of a small hangar and flight deck capability for the QH-50 DASH (Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopter).</li>
</ul>
<p>The FRAM modernization allowed the <strong>DD-849</strong> to extend her operational life significantly and maintain relevance throughout the demanding decades of the 1960s, often deployed to the Caribbean for exercises or serving on the Atlantic barrier patrols.</p>

<h2>The Crucial Transformation: Becoming AG-151</h2>

<p>As the 1960s drew to a close, many of the older FRAM-I destroyers began to be retired or transferred to foreign navies. However, the <strong>USS Richard E. Kraus</strong> received a unique reprieve and a new mission that secured her place in naval history: becoming an experimental test ship.</p>

<p>In 1969, the <strong>DD-849</strong> was formally redesignated as an Auxiliary General (AG) and assigned the hull number <strong>AG-151</strong>. This conversion required stripping much of her primary combat armament and installing sophisticated scientific and sensor testing equipment.</p>

<p>The transformation into AG-151 was strategic. The Navy needed specialized platforms to test advanced sonar domes, new radar configurations, acoustic signatures for future ship classes, and complex drone guidance systems without tying up active combat vessels. The reliable Gearing hull, having already undergone the rigorous FRAM upgrades, provided the perfect stable platform for this delicate research.</p>

<p>Operating out of the Charleston Naval Base and later, specialized testing facilities, the <strong>USS Richard E. Kraus (AG-151)</strong> became a vital, unsung laboratory. Her missions were classified and highly technical, directly influencing the development of the sophisticated electronic warfare and detection systems employed by US Navy ships in the late 20th century.</p>

<h2>Supporting the Fleet: The Test Ship Years (AG-151)</h2>

<p>As <strong>AG-151</strong>, the ship served a completely different purpose than her destroyer contemporaries. Her crew consisted not just of sailors maintaining the vessel, but highly specialized technicians, engineers, and scientists. The noise she made, the way she maneuvered, and the energy she consumed were all carefully measured data points.</p>

<p>Among her most significant contributions during this phase was the testing and refinement of various new sonar arrays. Acoustic superiority was paramount in the Cold War ASW race, and the <strong>Richard E. Kraus</strong> helped validate new hull-mounted and towed sonar designs that would soon outfit advanced frigates and destroyers.</p>

<p>Furthermore, her transformation allowed her to participate in critical tests related to the evolving capability of unmanned vehicles. The ability to remotely control and monitor specialized vessels and air drones was a burgeoning area of naval technology, and <strong>AG-151</strong> provided the stable command and control platform necessary for these complex experiments.</p>

<p>Her role was that of a technology enabler, extending the legacy of PFC Kraus by ensuring that the next generation of US Navy sailors would be equipped with the best possible tools to defend freedom.</p>

<h2>Decommissioning and Final Chapter</h2>

<p>After a total of 30 years of continuous service, encompassing global patrols, crucial modernization, and groundbreaking scientific research, the aging hull of the <strong>USS Richard E. Kraus (AG-151)</strong> had reached the end of its useful life.</p>

<p>She was decommissioned on July 1, 1976. This date marked the end of the line for a ship that had embodied the transition from post-WWII conventional warfare to the technological arms race of the late Cold War. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register the same day, she waited for her final assignment.</p>

<p>Like many of her peers, the <strong>USS Richard E. Kraus</strong> was designated as a target ship. In July 1977, she was utilized in naval exercises off the coast of Puerto Rico, where she was sunk by fleet units. Her sacrifice, like that of her namesake, ultimately served a training purpose—providing valuable practical experience for the naval forces that would follow.</p>

<h2>The Enduring Legacy of DD-849/AG-151</h2>

<p>The history of the <strong>USS Richard E. Kraus (DD-849/AG-151)</strong> offers a compelling narrative of naval evolution. She was a Gearing-class destroyer that never fired a shot in the war for which she was designed, but she proved indispensable in the decades of global vigilance that followed. She upheld the tradition of honor and service associated with her namesake, PFC Richard E. Kraus, first as a robust patrol destroyer and later as an indispensable test platform for naval research.</p>

<p>Her unique transformation into <strong>AG-151</strong> allowed her to influence naval architecture and electronic capabilities well into the future, cementing her status as a crucial, if often overlooked, asset of the Cold War Navy. The legacy of the <strong>USS Richard E. Kraus</strong> lives on in the improved sensor technology and refined combat systems that grace today’s advanced fleet.</p>
