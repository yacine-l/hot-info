## An Agricultural Enigma: Introducing the Ralphsnyder Decagonal Barn

<p>Deep within the rolling hills of Preston County, West Virginia, lies a unique structure that defies the traditional image of American farm architecture: the Ralphsnyder Decagonal Barn. While most historic barns are simple rectangles or squares, this 1890 marvel boasts a perfect ten-sided structure—a true decagon—making it an exceptional and singular piece of agricultural history. It is a landmark not just for the local community near Masontown, but for the entire state, holding the distinction of being the only ten-sided barn known to have been constructed in West Virginia.</p>

<p>The Ralphsnyder Decagonal Barn represents a fascinating intersection of pioneering ingenuity, architectural experimentation, and practical farming needs of the late 19th century. Its distinctive frame, combined with an unusually formal, almost ecclesiastical steeple-shaped cupola, draws the eye and prompts questions about the motivations behind its complicated design. To understand this historic building is to look beyond mere function and appreciate the ambition of builders who sought efficiency and aesthetic novelty in their daily work.</p>

<p>This article dives into the history, architecture, and enduring legacy of the Ralphsnyder Decagonal Barn, exploring why multi-sided barns were built, the challenges of its construction and preservation, and its place in the broader narrative of American farming architecture.</p>

## The Architectural Anomaly: Why Ten Sides in 1890?

<p>The construction of the Ralphsnyder Decagonal Barn in 1890 occurred during a period of intense agricultural reform and architectural innovation across the United States. While the decade immediately following the Civil War saw the rise of the octagonal (eight-sided) barn, the decagon (ten-sided) structure represents an even rarer, and arguably more complex, endeavor. The decision to build a ten-sided barn instead of a simple square or rectangular one was generally driven by several key factors:</p>

<ul>
    <li>**Efficiency of Space:** Circular and multi-sided barns offer a superior ratio of volume to surface area compared to square barns. This meant less material was needed for the walls relative to the storage capacity provided.</li>
    <li>**Centralized Workflow:** The radial plan allowed farmers to centralize feeding and storage operations. Animals could be kept in stalls ringing the perimeter, while a central crib or silo allowed for easy access and distribution of feed from the center, streamlining the work of the farmhands.</li>
    <li>**Structural Integrity:** The continuous nature of the multi-sided design provides exceptional resistance to strong winds and lateral pressure. A decagonal structure naturally distributes loads more effectively than a standard rectilinear building, a crucial advantage in areas prone to inclement weather.</li>
    <li>**Architectural Experimentation:** The builders were likely influenced by the prevailing architectural trends promoting efficiency, particularly those championed by figures like Orson Squire Fowler, who popularized the concept of octagonal residences and structures in the mid-19th century.</li>
</ul>

<p>The construction of the **Ralphsnyder Decagonal Barn** required careful planning. A ten-sided shape requires internal angles of 144 degrees. For builders working primarily with hand tools and limited surveying equipment in rural 1890 West Virginia, successfully calculating and framing ten perfectly aligned sides of a large structure was a remarkable feat of practical mathematics and carpentry skill. The result is a substantial frame building that is aesthetically harmonious yet profoundly functional.</p>

## The Steeple and the Sky: Details of the Unique Design

<p>While the decagonal shape of the barn is its most defining characteristic, the unique cupola atop the structure is perhaps its most recognizable and unusual feature. Unlike the typical simple vents or flat-topped monitoring roofs found on many round barns, the Ralphsnyder Decagonal Barn features a remarkable steeple-shaped cupola.</p>

<p>This steeple design is highly unusual for agricultural structures. Most cupolas are designed purely for practical ventilation, allowing warm, moisture-laden air and ammonia fumes from livestock to escape, thereby keeping the hay dry and preventing spontaneous combustion. While the Ralphsnyder cupola certainly serves this ventilation purpose, its sophisticated, pointed shape adds a level of formal elegance rarely associated with utilitarian farm buildings. It suggests an owner who valued both practicality and distinctiveness, perhaps even a subtle attempt to mimic the formal architecture of public buildings or churches.</p>

<p>Internally, the barn likely utilized a system of concentric rings or radiating beams to support the massive roof load required for a decagonal structure. These internal supports created bays used for storing hay and grains and housing livestock. The central space would have served as the core feeding or threshing area, reinforcing the efficient, labor-saving design principle inherent in all multi-sided barns.</p>

<p>The sheer engineering required to craft the conical roof structure—a feat of complex joinery needed to match the angles of the ten walls—speaks volumes about the skill of the original builders. Every rafter and truss had to be meticulously cut and secured to create the smooth slope that culminates in the striking steeple cupola.</p>

## A Story of Relocation and Renewal: The 1981 Move

<p>The existence of the Ralphsnyder Decagonal Barn today is a testament to dedicated preservation efforts. Like many historic structures, the barn faced threats from neglect or changing land usage, necessitating a dramatic intervention to save it for future generations. In 1981, the decision was made to move the entire massive ten-sided structure from its original location to its present site near Masontown.</p>

<p>Moving a standard rectangular structure is a complex endeavor; moving a 90-year-old historic decagonal structure is an exercise in extreme historical preservation and engineering precision. The process required meticulously dismantling and reassembling the large frame segments, ensuring that the unique angles and complex roof structure could be faithfully reconstructed.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the relocation effort necessitated significant replacement of materials. Portions of the original frame, compromised by age, weather, or the stress of the move, had to be replaced. Similarly, elements of the roof structure—particularly the roofing material itself—were updated or replaced to ensure the long-term integrity of the building. While purists might lament any modifications, these replacements were crucial to the barn's survival. The 1981 project essentially gifted the barn a new lease on life, allowing its unique architectural story to continue in Preston County.</p>

<p>The successful relocation of the **Ralphsnyder Decagonal Barn** is a celebrated achievement in West Virginia’s preservation history, highlighting the community’s recognition of this building’s profound cultural and historical value.</p>

## The Broader Context: Round Barns in American Agriculture

<p>To fully appreciate the uniqueness of the Ralphsnyder Decagonal Barn, one must understand the context of the American "Round Barn" movement. Though the vast majority of surviving multi-sided barns are octagonal or dodecagonal (12-sided), the underlying philosophical motivation was consistent.</p>

<p>The history of multi-sided farming structures dates back much further than the Ralphsnyder Barn’s 1890 construction. George Washington himself experimented with sixteen-sided threshing barns in the 1790s at Mount Vernon. However, the movement truly peaked in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, driven by agricultural colleges and published designs promoting efficiency.</p>

<p>Proponents of the round design claimed benefits that went beyond material savings. They argued that a round structure allowed for continuous, circular movement of wagons and livestock, eliminating bottlenecks and corners where dirt and disease often accumulated. The absence of square corners inside the barn was believed to discourage evil spirits, a superstitious but persistent belief among some rural communities, while practically, it made it easier to clean the stalls and central silo.</p>

<p>The shift to ten sides—rather than the more common eight or twelve—often depended on the specific span the builder was trying to achieve and the availability of materials and expertise. Fewer sides (like eight) made construction simpler but offered less of a "circular" effect; more sides (like sixteen) approximated a true circle but increased the complexity and sheer number of angles to be framed. The decagon offered a practical middle ground, combining near-circular efficiency with manageable construction requirements for the framers involved in the 1890 project.</p>

<p>Despite their clear advantages, round barns, including the Ralphsnyder Decagonal Barn, eventually fell out of favor. The rise of mechanized farming, standardization of building materials (like pre-cut lumber and metal fasteners), and the preference for modular, easily expandable structures (like rectangular pole barns) led to the decline of the sophisticated, high-labor multi-sided design by the 1920s.</p>

## Visiting the Monument: Preservation and Modern Legacy

<p>The Ralphsnyder Decagonal Barn remains a quiet but significant monument to the ingenuity of West Virginia’s past. Its singularity—the only known decagonal barn in the state—guarantees its importance in historical surveys of American architecture.</p>

<p>Located near Masontown, the barn serves as a reminder of the agricultural heritage of Preston County. While preservation efforts have succeeded in saving the structure, its importance transcends local history. It is a physical embodiment of the national movement toward efficiency and innovative design that defined late 19th-century agriculture.</p>

<p>For those interested in unique architectural landmarks or agricultural history, the **Ralphsnyder Decagonal Barn** offers a compelling glimpse into a bygone era.
