<p>The Italian Renaissance was not merely an age of artistic beauty and intellectual blossoming; it was a brutal, high-stakes game of power played out by dynastic families, mercenary armies, and the all-powerful College of Cardinals. At the epicenter of this storm stood <b>Ascanio Maria Sforza Visconti</b>, a man whose ambition was matched only by his political genius. More than just a cardinal, Sforza was the ultimate power broker, the architect of one of the most consequential papal elections in history, and a figure whose decisions irrevocably shaped the destiny of the Catholic Church and the Italian peninsula.</p>

<p>Often overshadowed by the infamous Borgias whom he helped rise, Cardinal Ascanio Sforza was a master diplomat and administrator. His career, spanning the turbulent late 15th and early 16th centuries, showcases the total entanglement of faith, wealth, and secular power. From his privileged Milanese upbringing to his tenure as Vice-Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church (1492–1505), Sforza navigated betrayal, war, and political collapse with remarkable agility. To understand the Borgia papacy, one must first understand the man who placed Rodrigo Borgia upon the throne of St. Peter.</p>

<h2>The Scion of Milan: Early Life and Political Ascent</h2>

<p>Born into one of Europe’s most powerful families, Ascanio Sforza’s destiny was intertwined with the fate of the Duchy of Milan. He was the sixth son of Francesco Sforza, the Duke of Milan, and Bianca Maria Visconti. This pedigree gave him immediate entry into the highest echelons of both Italian and ecclesiastical politics. While his older brother, Ludovico Sforza (known as "il Moro"), controlled Milan's secular affairs, Ascanio was tasked with securing the family's influence within the Church.</p>

<p>Ascanio Sforza’s training was purely political. He was granted his cardinalate in 1484 by Pope Sixtus IV, largely as a result of a power-sharing arrangement between the papacy and the Duchy of Milan. At only twenty-nine years old, he quickly established a formidable presence in Rome. Unlike many prelates who relied solely on spiritual authority, Sforza leveraged his family’s immense resources—money, military alliances, and diplomatic intelligence—to build his power base.</p>

<p>His early years were characterized by intense rivalry with other powerful cardinals, most notably Giuliano della Rovere (later Pope Julius II). This rivalry underscored a fundamental truth of Renaissance Rome: the College of Cardinals was less a spiritual body and more a battleground for dynastic supremacy. Cardinal Sforza, representing Milanese interests, became a key leader among the younger, more ambitious cardinals, developing a reputation for shrewd calculation and persuasive diplomacy that would define his entire career.</p>

<h2>Renaissance Rome and the Machinery of Power</h2>

<p>By the late 1480s, Cardinal Sforza was one of the most influential figures operating within the Roman Curia. His palatial residence, the Palazzo Riario (later known as the Cancelleria), was a center of diplomatic activity, intrigue, and lavish spending. Sforza understood that influence was purchased not just with votes, but with patronage, debt, and the ability to distribute the vast wealth of the Church.</p>

<p>His administrative skills allowed him to accumulate numerous benefices, meaning he controlled multiple bishoprics and abbacies simultaneously, generating staggering revenues that were then reinvested into political maneuvering. Sforza was a central figure in the various diplomatic crises that plagued the Papal States, acting as an indispensable intermediary between the papacy and the various Italian League states.</p>

<p>Key to his strategy was the cultivation of a reliable bloc of cardinals who owed him favors or relied on him for political protection. This preparation, patiently executed over nearly a decade, was instrumental in allowing him to dictate the outcome of the most important event of his life: the Conclave of 1492.</p>

<h2>The Conclave of 1492: Making Pope Alexander VI</h2>

<p>When Pope Innocent VIII died in July 1492, the stage was set for one of the most competitive and scandalous papal elections in history. The principal contenders were:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>**Giuliano della Rovere:** Backed by the French and Genoese, representing the traditional, military-minded Italian noble families.</li>
    <li>**Rodrigo Borgia:** The wealthy and politically astute Vice-Chancellor, who was known for his administrative competence and vast, though controversial, personal wealth.</li>
    <li>**Ascanio Sforza:** While he harbored papal ambitions, he quickly realized that his path to ultimate power lay not in securing the papal tiara for himself, but in selecting and controlling the victor.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Conclave quickly devolved into a strategic negotiation characterized by open promises of offices, gold, and influence—a practice known as simony, though common at the time. Ascanio Sforza initially held the balance of power. His supporters were numerous and unified, making his endorsement the critical factor needed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority.</p>

<p>Sforza’s decision to back Rodrigo Borgia was the result of a meticulously calculated agreement. Borgia, despite being the wealthiest candidate, needed Sforza’s organizational skill and diplomatic bloc to overcome della Rovere’s influence. The resulting deal was staggering in its scope:</p>

<ol>
    <li>**The Vice-Chancellorship:** The highest and most lucrative administrative office in the Curia, which Borgia himself held, was promised to Sforza.</li>
    <li>**The Palazzo Borgia:** Sforza was gifted Borgia’s sumptuous personal residence, complete with all its silver and furnishings.</li>
    <li>**Extensive Benefices and Cash:** Sforza received immense revenues from several bishoprics, confirming his status as one of the richest men in Italy.</li>
</ol>

<p>The moment Cardinal Sforza publicly switched his allegiance and brought his powerful block of cardinals to Borgia, the election was decided. On August 11, 1492, Rodrigo Borgia was elected, taking the name Pope Alexander VI. The immediate elevation of <b>Ascanio Sforza</b> to the position of Vice-Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church cemented his status as the second most powerful man in the Catholic world, and the true political manager of the new papacy.</p>

<h2>The Years of Power: Vice-Chancellor and Diplomatic Mastery</h2>

<p>For the first few years of Alexander VI’s reign, the partnership between the Pope and the Vice-Chancellor Ascanio Sforza was robust. Sforza, now formally administering the Church’s central bureaucratic machinery, used his position to enrich his family and protect Milanese interests. His brother, Ludovico il Moro, now had a critical advocate and representative at the highest level in Rome, greatly enhancing Milan’s standing against its rivals, Florence and Naples.</p>

<p>However, the smooth alliance quickly fractured due to the arrival of international powers in Italian affairs. In 1494, King Charles VIII of France invaded Italy, aiming to claim the Kingdom of Naples. This invasion forced Pope Alexander VI to choose a side, a choice complicated by Sforza’s shifting allegiances.</p>

<p>Initially, Sforza supported the French, aligning with his brother Ludovico, who had foolishly invited Charles VIII into Italy. However, as the French became a direct military threat to the Papal States, Alexander VI shifted his loyalty, forming a crucial alliance with Spain and Venice. Cardinal Sforza, caught between his papal responsibilities and his filial loyalty to Milan, found himself increasingly marginalized and mistrusted by Alexander VI and his ambitious son, Cesare Borgia.</p>

<p>The rivalry between the Borgias and the Sforzas exploded in 1499 when the French, now allied with the Papacy, launched an attack on Milan. Ludovico il Moro was captured, and the Sforza dynasty in Milan was overthrown. Stripped of his secular power base, Cardinal Sforza fled Rome, knowing that his usefulness—and therefore his protection—had expired.</p>

<h2>Imprisonment, Return, and Final Legacy</h2>

<p>Cardinal Sforza’s remaining years were marked by turbulence and eventual restoration. After attempting to rally support for his imprisoned brother, Sforza himself was captured by French forces and held for months. He eventually returned to Rome, but only after making peace with Alexander VI, though he never fully regained his former influence.</p>

<p>The rise of Cesare Borgia as the Pope’s military commander further complicated life for <b>Ascanio Sforza</b>. Cesare systematically dismantled the power of the old Roman noble families (Colonna, Orsini) and demanded absolute loyalty. The shrewd cardinal was eventually imprisoned by Alexander VI again in 1503, just before the Pope’s death.</p>

<p>The death of Alexander VI provided Ascanio Sforza with a final, dramatic political opportunity. Released from prison, he participated in the subsequent short conclave that elected Pope Pius III, and then played a vital role in the election of his old rival, Giuliano della Rovere (now Pope Julius II). This final act of diplomatic maneuvering—supporting the very man he once blocked—demonstrated Sforza’s pragmatism and desire for political rehabilitation.</p>

<p>He was confirmed by Julius II in his high offices, but his health was failing. <b>Ascanio Maria Sforza Visconti</b> died in Rome in May 1505, leaving behind a reputation as one of the most financially and politically powerful cardinals of the entire Renaissance period.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: The Diplomat Who Defined an Era</h2>

<p>Ascanio Sforza’s life encapsulates the ambition, danger, and glittering intrigue of the High Renaissance. He was an ecclesiastical prince whose vast administrative and diplomatic skills were entirely devoted to secular power. His greatest achievement—the strategic decision to back Rodrigo Borgia—did not merely change the occupant of the papal throne; it ushered in the most controversial and politically potent era of papal history.</p>

<p>While history often focuses on the Borgia family’s spectacular scandals, it was the brilliant calculation of <b>Cardinal Sforza</b> that initially fueled their rise. He remains a powerful reminder that in Renaissance politics, the true game was played by the diplomats, and Ascanio Sforza was among the most skilled of them all.</p>
