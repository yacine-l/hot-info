<h2>The Essential Flavor of Funk Jazz: Rediscovering John Wright's Nice 'n' Tasty</h2>

<p>In the vast, sprawling catalog of jazz history, certain albums achieve legendary status, while others—equally brilliant and foundational—become quietly revered secrets passed among devoted aficionados. John Wright's 1960 release, <em>Nice 'n' Tasty</em>, falls squarely into the latter category. Recorded and released during the golden age of hard bop and the nascent emergence of soul jazz, this Prestige Records gem is far more than just a footnote; it is a definitive statement on the power of blues-inflected, deeply groovy piano music.</p>

<p>At a time when jazz was wrestling with the complexity of modal composition (Miles Davis's <em>Kind of Blue</em> had just redefined the landscape), John Wright offered an essential counterpoint: music rooted in earth, gospel, and rhythm. <em>Nice 'n' Tasty</em> is a testament to the Chicago-born pianist’s ability to infuse sophisticated jazz structures with an undeniable, accessible funk. For those seeking the purest expression of the soul jazz movement—the moment when hard bop got greasy—this album remains a mandatory listen.</p>

<p>This article explores the context of the album, the genius of John Wright, the crucial role of Prestige Records, and the enduring musical legacy of this savory 1960 recording.</p>

<h2>John Wright: The Unsung Master of the Soulful Keyboard</h2>

<p>To fully appreciate <em>Nice 'n' Tasty</em>, one must first understand John Wright (born 1934) himself. Wright was a pianist whose musical grounding was distinctly different from the intellectual virtuosity of bebop pioneers. Raised in Chicago, his earliest and most profound influences stemmed from the South Side’s churches, blues clubs, and rhythm and blues circuits.</p>

<p>While technical brilliance was never absent from his playing, Wright prioritized feeling and rhythmic intensity over dazzling, rapid-fire scalar runs. His style was characterized by:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Gospel Voicings:</strong> Heavy, resonant chords often played in the lower registers, echoing the call-and-response dynamics of the church organ.</li>
    <li><strong>Rhythmic Authority:</strong> A highly percussive touch, turning the piano into a driving rhythm instrument as much as a melodic one.</li>
    <li><strong>Blues Infusion:</strong> Deep, earthy blues scales and phrasing formed the core of his improvisations, making his solos immediately relatable and visceral.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wright arrived on the national scene slightly later than some of his peers, but his contributions, particularly his trio work on Prestige, cemented him as a pivotal figure in the growing soul jazz niche. Albums like <em>Nice 'n' Tasty</em> demonstrated that simplicity of theme could lead to profound emotional depth, carving out a space for piano that emphasized the groove above all else.</p>

<h2>Prestige Records and the 1960 Soul Jazz Renaissance</h2>

<p>The year 1960 was a watershed moment for jazz. It was also a peak year for Prestige Records, the label founded by Bob Weinstock. Prestige was renowned for its efficient recording philosophy: quick sessions, minimal takes, and a focus on capturing raw, authentic performances. This environment proved perfect for musicians like John Wright, who thrived on spontaneity and rhythmic chemistry.</p>

<p>The label’s sound was often defined by the engineering genius of Rudy Van Gelder, who recorded <em>Nice 'n' Tasty</em> at his legendary Englewood Cliffs studio. Van Gelder’s technique gave the instruments—particularly the bass and drums—a tremendous presence and clarity, lending the recordings an immediate, almost tactile quality that perfectly served the new "funk" sound.</p>

<p>The rise of soul jazz in the late 1950s and early 1960s was partly a commercial necessity and partly an artistic evolution. As traditional bop became highly complex, the market embraced a more accessible, blues-heavy style. Prestige capitalized on this shift, establishing itself as the home for artists delivering this potent new genre:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Soul jazz used familiar structures (the 12-bar blues) and recognizable rhythmic patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>The Groove Factor:</strong> It was danceable and deeply rhythmic, bridging the gap between jazz and R&B.</li>
    <li><strong>Key Collaborators:</strong> Prestige simultaneously recorded similar, highly successful soul jazz albums by artists like Gene Ammons, Jack McDuff, and Richard "Groove" Holmes, placing Wright squarely in elite company.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Nice 'n' Tasty</em> benefited from this context, positioned as an album that promised—and delivered—a solid hour of unpretentious, swinging music designed for enjoyment rather than academic study.</p>

<h2>Analyzing the Flavor: The Sonic Ingredients of Nice 'n' Tasty</h2>

<p>The core lineup for the <em>Nice 'n' Tasty</em> session, typically a simple trio setup (piano, bass, drums), or sometimes a quartet augmented by a saxophone or guitar, allowed Wright’s piano to dominate the texture. Regardless of the exact personnel (which often featured stellar, hard-working session musicians of the era), the chemistry is palpable.</p>

<p>The defining characteristic of this album is its masterful combination of simplicity and intensity. Unlike the frenetic pace of bebop, Wright’s grooves are deliberate and deep. He rarely rushes a phrase, allowing the blues structure to dictate the emotional pacing.</p>

<h3>The Art of the Groove</h3>

<p>Wright’s left hand acts as a relentless anchor, driving the rhythm forward with simple, powerful root-fifth patterns, or occasionally complex boogie-woogie bass lines that rarely stray too far from the functional heart of the blues. This grounded approach frees his right hand to explore melodic ideas that are equally rooted in soulful expression.</p>

<p>A crucial element of the album’s sound is the interaction with the rhythm section. The bass lines are heavy and walking, often utilizing a distinctive, woody tone that Van Gelder captured beautifully. The drumming is often minimalist—focusing on maintaining the deep backbeat and offering subtle, perfectly timed accents rather than lengthy, showy solos. This restraint creates a unified, potent rhythmic whole, allowing the piano to be the main melodic voice while the rhythm section provides unshakeable foundation.</p>

<h3>The Track List Philosophy</h3>

<p>The selection of tracks on <em>Nice 'n' Tasty</em> is a perfectly curated journey through the soul jazz repertoire, typically featuring a mix of Wright originals, sophisticated standards, and mandatory blues showcases:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>The Title Track:</strong> Often an original composition, the title track is typically a medium-tempo cooker, introducing the album’s infectious, easy swing and setting the expectation of a relaxed, yet intense listening experience.</li>
    <li><strong>The Blues Showcase:</strong> Every Prestige soul jazz album required a heavy blues workout. These tracks allowed Wright to deploy his most powerful, gospel-infused chord clusters and showcase his affinity for gutbucket truth.</li>
    <li><strong>The Ballad:</strong> Crucial for demonstrating versatility, the ballad on <em>Nice 'n' Tasty</em> reveals a sensitive side to Wright’s playing, where his touch becomes tender, focusing on lyrical interpretation rather than pure rhythm.</li>
    <li><strong>The Standard Reimagined:</strong> Taking a Tin Pan Alley standard and giving it a "funk" makeover was a hallmark of the genre. Wright often slowed down or rearranged these familiar tunes, highlighting the rhythmic possibilities hidden within their structures.</li>
</ol>

<p>Collectively, these ingredients result in an album that feels effortlessly cool, the sound of a musician deeply comfortable in his own skin and utterly fluent in the language of the blues.</p>

<h2>The Enduring Legacy and Reassessment</h2>

<p>Despite its quality, John Wright’s career was not characterized by the kind of superstar status afforded to artists like Oscar Peterson or Horace Silver. For many years, <em>Nice 'n' Tasty</em> was primarily known among vinyl collectors and jazz historians as a deep cut from the Prestige catalog.</p>

<p>However, the 21st century has seen a significant reassessment of soul jazz and its pioneers. As listeners and critics have looked beyond the well-worn paths of bebop and modal jazz, they have rediscovered the raw, emotional power of records like <em>Nice 'n' Tasty</em>. Its influence can be heard in:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The resurgence of organ jazz, which shares Wright’s commitment to gospel and rhythm.</li>
    <li>Contemporary pianists who consciously choose to emphasize groove and simplicity over intellectual complexity.</li>
    <li>The overall recognition of the Chicago jazz scene's unique contribution to the hard bop lineage.</li>
</ul>

<p>The album’s title perfectly encapsulates its contents: it is immediately appealing ("nice") and structurally satisfying ("tasty"). It doesn't challenge the listener with abstract concepts; instead, it invites them into a warm, soulful sonic landscape that is quintessentially American and undeniably jazz.</p>

<h2>Why Nice 'n' Tasty Remains Essential Listening</h2>

<p>Recorded in 1960 and expertly captured by the Prestige machinery, John Wright’s <em>Nice 'n' Tasty</em> stands as a monumental piece of soul jazz history. It serves as a crucial bridge between the sophisticated structures of hard bop and the earthy, gospel-drenched sound that would define the genre for the subsequent decade. The album is a masterclass in trio dynamics, rhythmic authority, and blues expression.</p>

<p>For those seeking to explore the deep grooves of early 1960s jazz, or for fans of piano music that prioritizes feeling over flash, <em>Nice 'n' Tasty</em> offers an experience that is rich, satisfying, and enduringly relevant. It is a vital reminder that the most profound jazz often speaks the most directly to the soul.</p>

<p>If this album has slipped past your radar, it is time to give this savory jazz classic the attention it richly deserves.</p>
