## CONTENT

<p>The Wars of Scottish Independence (1296–1357) were defined not just by great sweeping battles like Stirling Bridge and Bannockburn, but by the relentless defiance of individual Scottish leaders who refused to bend the knee to English power. Among these figures, few demonstrated such sheer, unyielding fortitude as Sir William Oliphant, Lord of Aberdalgie and Dupplin.</p>

<p>A powerful magnate in the late 13th century, Oliphant’s story is a compelling chronicle of shifting allegiances, immense personal risk, and legendary stubbornness. He was a quintessential Scottish knight—fiercely loyal to the concept of Scottish sovereignty, even when the nation itself seemed fractured and beaten. While many nobles capitulated to the might of Edward I ‘Longshanks,’ Oliphant’s name became synonymous with resistance, largely due to a single, epic stand that cemented his place in military history: the Siege of Stirling Castle.</p>

<p>This article delves into the life and legacy of Sir William Oliphant, examining how his actions shaped the trajectory of the Scottish struggle for freedom and why his defense of Stirling remains a testament to indomitable courage.</p>

<h2>The Roots of a Magnate: Oliphant’s Early Life and Allegiances</h2>

<p>The Oliphant family had deep roots in the Scottish aristocracy, holding significant lands in Perthshire, including the baronies of Aberdalgie and Dupplin. Sir William inherited a position of wealth and influence, placing him firmly among the political elite. However, his life began during the tumultuous period following the death of King Alexander III, which plunged Scotland into a succession crisis.</p>

<p>Like many Scottish lords, Oliphant was forced to navigate the political storm brought by Edward I of England, who asserted himself as Overlord of Scotland. Initially, Oliphant, along with other nobles, swore fealty to Edward I in the Ragman Roll of 1296. Such oaths, however, were often pragmatic necessities rather than heartfelt commitments. When the opportunity arose, Scottish patriotism quickly resurfaced.</p>

<p>Oliphant soon broke his vassalage, joining the nationalist movement. His commitment to the cause was demonstrated early on when he was captured by the English following the disastrous Battle of Dunbar in 1296. He was imprisoned, but later released, only to immediately rejoin the resistance against Edward I, proving his unwavering dedication to the concept of an independent Scotland.</p>

<h2>The Crucible of War: Falkirk and the Rise of Robert the Bruce</h2>

<p>By the turn of the 14th century, the Scottish resistance had suffered devastating losses, most notably the crushing defeat at the Battle of Falkirk in 1298, which severely diminished the strength of William Wallace’s movement. Despite these setbacks, strongholds continued to hold out. Stirling Castle, the strategic key to the whole kingdom, was crucial, situated atop a volcanic crag overlooking the crucial crossing points of the River Forth.</p>

<p>After Wallace’s loss, the castle came back into Scottish hands. In 1303, with the English King Edward I launching a massive, coordinated invasion aimed at extinguishing the resistance once and for all, Sir William Oliphant was entrusted with the castle's command. This appointment was a measure of the trust placed in his military competence and, perhaps more importantly, his legendary stubbornness.</p>

<p>Oliphant understood that while the rest of Scotland might fall—as most of the nobility had once again submitted to Edward that year—Stirling Castle could not be easily bypassed. It represented the final, defiant symbol of Scottish statehood.</p>

<h2>The Defining Stand: The Epic Siege of Stirling Castle (1304)</h2>

<p>The Siege of Stirling Castle remains Oliphant’s great historical achievement, a masterful demonstration of defensive warfare carried out against overwhelming odds. Edward I, determined to secure Scotland absolutely, amassed an army and brought the full weight of his logistical power to bear upon the fortress.</p>

<p>The siege began in April 1304. Oliphant commanded a meager garrison—fewer than 150 men—yet he held firm against an army numbering thousands, personally led by the English King. Edward I was incensed by the resistance. He employed every weapon available, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Twelve massive siege engines, continuously battering the walls.</li>
    <li>Fires, using Greek fire (a form of early napalm) and burning brands, launched against the wooden structures.</li>
    <li>Constant assaults aimed at undermining the foundation of the walls.</li>
</ul>

<p>For three grueling months, Oliphant’s small force resisted. Edward I, impatient and infuriated by the delay, famously commissioned the construction of the greatest trebuchet ever built in the British Isles: **The War Wolf (or *Loup-de-Guerre*)**.</p>

<h3>The Fury of the War Wolf</h3>
<p>The War Wolf was a technological marvel of medieval destruction, requiring teams of specialized engineers and laborers to build and operate. Oliphant and his men watched its construction, knowing full well that once operational, their position would become untenable. Despite recognizing the futility of further resistance against such a weapon, Oliphant refused to surrender.</p>

<p>Edward I offered terms to the garrison if they would surrender before the War Wolf was fully assembled. Oliphant refused, citing his oath of loyalty to the King of Scotland and famously asserting that he would not surrender the castle until he received a direct order from his superior, Sir John de Soulis (who was in France at the time), or Edward I granted him a pardon for his past resistance.</p>

<p>This defiance infuriated Edward I. The English King, driven by rage and vanity, completed the War Wolf. When the colossal machine finally began hurling massive stones—reportedly weighing up to 300 pounds—against the central gatehouse, the fortress finally began to crumble.</p>

<p>On July 24, 1304, realizing his position was hopeless and that further bloodshed was unnecessary, Oliphant finally surrendered. However, Edward I’s fury was not quenched. He refused to allow the garrison immediate mercy. Instead, he forced Oliphant and his exhausted men to wait outside the demolished gate while he watched the War Wolf fire a few more salvos, simply for the sheer spectacle of total destruction.</p>

<h2>From Defender to Captive: The Price of Defiance</h2>

<p>Oliphant was punished harshly for his audacity. While many other Scottish nobles who had resisted were granted reasonable terms after submitting in 1304, Edward I singled out Oliphant. He was immediately stripped of his lands and titles (forfeiture) and imprisoned in the Tower of London, followed by repeated relocations to various strongholds in England.</p>

<p>His captivity lasted for years, but his imprisonment did not break his resolve. He became a symbol of national defiance. It was not until the rise of Robert the Bruce—who killed the rival claimant John Comyn and crowned himself King of Scots in 1306—that Oliphant’s fate changed.</p>

<p>Bruce’s early success and the growing instability in Scotland following the death of Edward I in 1307 shifted the diplomatic landscape. Oliphant was finally released around 1308, likely as part of a prisoner exchange or a diplomatic maneuver intended to stabilize the border.</p>

<h2>Returning to the Fight: Oliphant After Captivity</h2>

<p>Upon his release, Sir William Oliphant returned to Scotland and immediately committed himself to the cause of King Robert the Bruce, recognizing him as the legitimate Scottish monarch. He fought actively in Bruce’s campaigns to consolidate power, helping to reclaim the lands lost to the English and to drive out the remaining 'Comyn faction' (rival Scottish nobles who supported the English). Oliphant was recognized for his staunch loyalty and had his forfeited lands, including Aberdalgie and Dupplin, restored.</p>

<p>He continued to serve Bruce faithfully for the remainder of the king’s life. However, the Oliphant name gained further, albeit tragic, notoriety in the years following Robert the Bruce’s death in 1329.</p>

<h3>The Fateful Field of Dupplin Moor</h3>
<p>While Sir William Oliphant, the defender of Stirling, passed away sometime before 1332, his descendants inherited his lands and titles, including the Lordship of Dupplin. The famous, devastating defeat of the loyalist Scots by the 'Disinherited' (English-backed Balliol supporters) occurred at the Battle of Dupplin Moor in 1332, right on the Oliphant family lands. This disaster signaled the start of the Second War of Scottish Independence.</p>

<p>Though the elder Sir William Oliphant was not present at Dupplin Moor, the location and the prominence of his family underscore the continuous involvement of the Oliphants in the most critical conflicts defining Scotland's sovereignty throughout the 14th century.</p>

<h2>The Enduring Legacy of the Defender</h2>

<p>Sir William Oliphant, Lord of Aberdalgie and Dupplin, is remembered not for winning a battle, but for refusing to lose a principle. His defense of Stirling Castle was one of the longest and most impressive acts of defiance during the Wars of Scottish Independence, delaying the English consolidation of power and providing a vital psychological boost to the weary Scottish cause.</p>

<p>His resilience proved that even in the face of overwhelming technological and military superiority—represented by Edward I’s infamous War Wolf—the spirit of Scottish independence could not be easily crushed. Oliphant set a standard for national pride that inspired later generations of Scottish freedom fighters.</p>

<p>The Oliphant family continued to be influential, eventually holding the title of Lord Oliphant, cementing their legacy among the ancient peerage of Scotland—a legacy founded on the indomitable courage of Sir William, the defender of the last Scottish bastion.</p>

<h2>FAQs on Sir William Oliphant</h2>

<h3>Q: Why was Stirling Castle so important?</h3>
<p>A: Stirling Castle was geographically vital. It controlled the main route between the Highlands and the Lowlands of Scotland, especially the lowest crossing point of the River Forth. Whoever held Stirling essentially held the key to controlling the Scottish kingdom.</p>

<h3>Q: What was the ‘War Wolf’?</h3>
<p>A: The War Wolf (*Loup-de-Guerre*) was the name given to the colossal trebuchet constructed by Edward I’s engineers during the 1304 Siege of Stirling. It was necessary because the castle’s defenses were too strong for standard siege engines. It was capable of launching massive stones and was considered the most formidable siege weapon of its time.</p>

<h3>Q: Did Oliphant ever fight alongside William Wallace or Robert the Bruce?</h3>
<p>A: While Oliphant was part of the nationalist movement contemporaneous with Wallace, the historical record doesn't show him fighting directly alongside Wallace in key battles like Stirling Bridge (1297) or Falkirk (1298). However, he certainly aligned with the cause Wallace represented. Later, after his release from English imprisonment (c. 1308), he served King Robert the Bruce loyally.</p>

<h3>Q: What happened to Sir William Oliphant after the siege?</h3>
<p>A: Oliphant was captured, imprisoned, and had his lands forfeited by Edward I. He endured harsh captivity for several years in England, a direct punishment for his defiance. He was released around 1308 and rejoined the Scottish cause, fighting for Robert the Bruce until his death sometime before 1332.</p>
