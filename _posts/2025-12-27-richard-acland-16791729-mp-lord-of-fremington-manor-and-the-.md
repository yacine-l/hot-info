## The Acland Influence: Richard Acland and the Seat of North Devon Power

Richard Acland (1679–1729) stands as a significant, yet often overshadowed, figure in the history of both the prominent Acland family and the parliamentary representation of North Devon. Living through the late Stuart period and the transition into the Georgian age, Acland’s life encompassed the shifting allegiances and fierce local rivalries that defined English politics in the early 18th century.

As the Lord of the Manor of Fremington, a strategic seat near the burgeoning port of Barnstaple, Acland naturally held considerable local authority. This landholding, combined with his family’s immense prestige, paved the way for his relatively short but impactful career as a Member of Parliament for Barnstaple from 1708 to 1713.

This exploration delves into the context of Acland’s life: the immense power wielded by his family, the importance of Fremington Manor as a political base, and the specific parliamentary context—the polarizing politics during the height of the War of the Spanish Succession under Queen Anne.

## The Acland Dynasty in Devon

To understand Richard Acland, one must first appreciate the scale of the Acland family’s influence in the West Country. While Richard belonged to the Fremington branch, the broader Acland lineage was synonymous with the landed gentry of Devon, holding vast estates centered at Holnicote in Somerset and Killerton in Devon. They were one of the great aristocratic families who effectively controlled the political and economic landscape of the county for centuries.

By the late 17th century, the Aclands possessed the wealth, connections, and tenant base necessary to dominate local elections. Their support—or opposition—could make or break a candidate in parliamentary boroughs across Devon. Richard Acland benefitted directly from this established network.

Richard Acland himself was the son of Sir Hugh Acland, 5th Baronet, and Anne Daniel. Born into the highest levels of the gentry, Richard was assured an education fitting his status and the assumption of local responsibilities. Unlike some family members who dedicated their lives solely to estate management, Richard was steered toward active political involvement, particularly in the nearby borough of Barnstaple, where the family held significant sway.

## Fremington Manor: A Base of Operations

Fremington Manor was central to Richard Acland’s identity and political power. Located west of Barnstaple, the manor was more than just a residence; it was a socio-economic nucleus that anchored the Acland’s control over a large swath of North Devon.

The manor’s strategic position was key:

*   **Estate Control:** As Lord of the Manor, Acland managed the local judiciary (manorial courts), controlled land tenure, and oversaw agricultural production, ensuring the loyalty and deference of numerous tenants.
*   **Proximity to Barnstaple:** Fremington lay close enough to the major trading port of Barnstaple to allow Acland to influence the mercantile interests and civic governance of the borough without being fully entangled in its daily municipal politics.
*   **Regional Status:** Fremington’s history added gravitas. It was an ancient holding, reaffirming the Acland family’s deep roots and legitimacy among the older Devonshire families.

This land base provided the financial stability and the localized power bloc necessary for a successful parliamentary campaign, where influence—often exerted through hospitality, economic pressure, and traditional loyalty—was the primary tool of electioneering.

## Barnstaple in the Early 18th Century: A Political Crucible

The borough of Barnstaple during the reigns of William III and Queen Anne was a notoriously competitive and often chaotic political environment. It was a thriving maritime town, heavily invested in the Newfoundland and American trade, which meant its political interests often diverged from the purely agricultural interests of the surrounding landed gentry.

Barnstaple was a ‘port borough,’ meaning its electorate (the ‘freemen’ of the corporation) was a mix of wealthy merchants, legal professionals, and tradesmen. This created a tension between:

1.  The traditional, landed **Tory** interest (like the Aclands), focused on supporting the Anglican Church, minimizing foreign entanglement, and protecting agricultural rents.
2.  The commercial **Whig** interest, focused on promoting trade, often favoring a robust prosecution of the continental wars, and advocating for greater religious tolerance (especially for Dissenters who were crucial to the mercantile class).

### The 1708 Election and the Tory Triumph

Richard Acland first stood for Barnstaple in the general election of 1708. This was a critical time in national politics. The war against France was dragging on, and public opinion was beginning to turn against the ruling Whig ministry, led by figures like Marlborough and Godolphin.

Acland successfully ran on the Tory ticket. His campaign was likely heavily financed and supported by the powerful regional influence of the Aclands and their allies. The success of Acland and his running mate reflected a temporary swing in the borough back toward the traditional gentry interest, likely capitalizing on anti-war sentiment and resentment over high taxes supporting the continental conflict.

His victory cemented the fact that while Barnstaple was commercial, the landed gentry could still leverage their enormous local resources to secure one of the borough’s two seats.

## A Parliamentary Career (1708–1713): A Backbencher in a Tumultuous House

Richard Acland’s tenure in the House of Commons coincided precisely with the final, dramatic years of Queen Anne’s reign—an era marked by extreme partisanship and the collapse of the Whig dominance.

### Allegiance and Voting Record

Acland was a committed, high-church Tory. His voting record and known affiliations place him firmly within the ranks of those who opposed the continuation of the War of the Spanish Succession and desired to curb the power of the Whig ministry.

Key aspects of his parliamentary service included:

*   **The Sacheverell Affair (1709–1710):** Acland would have been strongly sympathetic to the High-Church Tory divine, Dr. Henry Sacheverell, who was impeached by the Whig government for preaching sermons against religious tolerance and the Revolution Settlement. The subsequent riots in London confirmed the deep political divide and favored the Tories.
*   **The Peace of Utrecht:** As a Tory, Acland would have supported the drive toward peace with France, culminating in the Treaty of Utrecht (1713). This policy was the central achievement of the Harley–St. John ministry, which he supported.
*   **The 'October Club':** Although documentation is sparse, many provincial Tory MPs of this era belonged to the 'October Club'—a powerful pressure group of backbenchers who demanded faster action on peace and harsher policies against Dissenters. Given Acland’s status and allegiance, it is highly probable he associated with this influential faction.

### The 1710 Election: A Resounding Success

The 1710 general election saw a national tidal wave of support for the Tories, largely fueled by the anti-Whig backlash generated by the Sacheverell trial. Barnstaple followed suit, re-electing Acland and reinforcing the Tory grip on the borough. This parliament (1710–1713) was the most Tory-dominated assembly of the era, and Acland served during its most productive and controversial sessions.

## The End of the Political Road (1713)

Richard Acland’s parliamentary career ended abruptly in 1713. He did not stand for election in the general election of that year.

There are several plausible reasons for his decision, common among country gentry MPs:

1.  **Estate Demands:** For many MPs of the era, continuous attendance in London was burdensome, costly, and took them away from crucial estate management responsibilities at Fremington.
2.  **The Shift in Family Focus:** Richard’s younger half-brother, Sir Hugh Acland, 6th Baronet, was beginning to consolidate the wider family's political power, and focus may have shifted toward ensuring Hugh's ascendancy.
3.  **Political Exhaustion:** The extreme partisanship of the Queen Anne parliaments was exhausting. With the Peace of Utrecht achieved, the main Tory objective was secured, allowing backbenchers like Acland to retire from the national stage.

His retirement came just before the death of Queen Anne in 1714 and the subsequent Hanoverian succession. This succession immediately brought the Whig party back into power for the next half-century, making the period Acland served (1708–1713) the last significant stretch of High Tory dominance until decades later.

## Later Life and Legacy

Following his parliamentary service, Richard Acland retreated permanently to his role as Lord of Fremington Manor. He spent the remaining sixteen years of his life managing his estates and fulfilling his duties as a Justice of the Peace for Devon.

While his political career was brief, his importance lies in his representation of the quintessential early 18th-century country gentleman MP: a figure whose political power was rooted entirely in land ownership, who served the High Church and Tory interest, and who viewed parliamentary service as a duty tied to his local prestige rather than a lifelong profession.

Richard Acland died in 1729, leaving behind a legacy that was regional rather than national. He successfully navigated the treacherous political waters of the transition between the Stuart and Hanoverian dynasties, ensuring that the Acland family’s massive influence in North Devon remained intact, ready to be utilized by future generations of Acland parliamentarians. His life serves as a precise chronological marker, illustrating the height of Tory strength in the West Country before the long Whig supremacy under Robert Walpole.
