## The Masques Cycle: A Crucial, Confused Bridge in MTG History

Welcome, planeswalkers, to a deep dive into one of Magic: The Gathering’s most often misidentified and critically important story arcs: the Masques Cycle.

Often colloquially, and incorrectly, referred to as the “Masques Block,” this three-set sequence—comprising *Mercadian Masques* (1999), *Nemesis* (2000), and *Prophecy* (2000)—served as the essential narrative bridge between the sprawling *Urza’s Saga* and the climactic *Invasion* Block. It is a period defined by stealth, political intrigue, and the final preparations for war, primarily unfolding across the exotic, upside-down plane of Mercadia and the artificial hellscape of Rath.

Beyond its narrative significance within the larger Weatherlight Saga, the **Masques Block MTG** era holds a singular place in the game’s history due to a landmark decision made by Wizards of the Coast regarding card reprints. The very first set in this cycle, *Mercadian Masques*, was the inaugural expansion explicitly exempted from the infamous Reserved List, forever changing the economic and collectible landscape of Magic: The Gathering.

Understanding the Masques Cycle means understanding a moment of transition—both for the game's mechanics and its business practices.

## The Naming Convention and the Shift in MTG Production

Before delving into the story, it is necessary to address the technical nomenclature. For many years, players referred to any three-set sequence sharing a continuous storyline as a "block." The Masques Cycle, however, is frequently categorized differently due to its unique release structure and its immediate predecessor, the Rath Cycle (which included *Tempest*, *Stronghold*, and *Exodus*).

The Masques sets were developed during a period when WotC was actively streamlining its internal design structure. Unlike the heavily synergistic, interlocking design of the Urza Block, the Masques Cycle often felt like three distinct environments stitched together by a unifying storyline, traversing three different planes: Mercadia, Rath, and the climactic return to Dominaria.

### Why the Masques Cycle Matters Economically

The biggest historical footnote attached to this period is the **Reserved List**—a promise by WotC not to reprint specific, typically powerful, rare cards from sets prior to *Mercadian Masques*.

When *Mercadian Masques* was released, WotC announced that this set, and all subsequent core and expansion sets, would not be subject to the restrictions of the Reprint Policy. This ensured that while older cards retained their scarcity and value, new expansions could be reprinted as necessary for future supplemental products, improving access to essential formats like competitive Modern, Pioneer, and, eventually, Commander. This decision fundamentally signaled a shift toward making MTG a continually accessible, playable game, rather than solely a collector’s market for new sets.

## Set One: Mercadian Masques (October 1999) – Intrigue on the Upside-Down Mountain

The first set, *Mercadian Masques*, is arguably the most recognizable of the cycle, primarily due to its distinct setting and memorable mechanics. The story picks up after the conclusion of the Rath Cycle, with the crew of the *Weatherlight* fleeing the artificial plane of Rath and crashing onto the exotic, mercantile plane of **Mercadia**.

Mercadia is defined by its colossal, upside-down mountain, upon which the entire city of Mercadia rests. The setting emphasized political machinations, disguises (hence the name *Masques*), and a sense of confusion and danger. The crew of the *Weatherlight*, now led by the stalwart captain Gerrard, finds themselves embroiled in the politics of the powerful human trading houses and the marginalized creature population, the Cho-Marr.

### Key Mechanics of Mercadian Masques

*   **Rebels and Mercenaries:** This was the major mechanical theme of the set, featuring a complex tutoring mechanic. Creatures with the Rebel subtype could search the player's deck for other Rebels of equal or lesser cost and put them directly onto the battlefield. Mercenaries operated identically but tutored for other Mercenaries. This created powerful, tribal deck archetypes that required careful deck building and planning.
*   **Spellshapers:** A popular cycle of creatures that allowed players to discard a card and pay a mana cost to activate an ability that mimicked the effect of an existing powerful spell (e.g., [[Dawnstrider]] mimics [[Fog]]). Spellshapers provided incredible utility and card advantage in formats that could utilize graveyard mechanics.
*   **Masques:** Though not an official keyword, the set employed an underlying theme of deception, represented by effects that flipped cards, hid information, or changed creature types.

This set set the tone for the entire cycle: resources were tight, and card advantage through repeatable abilities (like Spellshapers) was highly prized.

## Set Two: Nemesis (February 2000) – Fading Back to Rath

*Nemesis* shifted the narrative back to the planes of Rath and Dominaria, focusing on the dark motivations and history of the villainous entity, Volrath. Gerrard and the *Weatherlight* crew are missing or scattered, forcing the secondary characters into the spotlight. The core focus is on the nature of Volrath’s identity (a twisted, corrupted changeling of the original Vuel) and the plight of the captured crew members like Ertai and Crovax.

The design of *Nemesis* was starkly different from *Masques*, returning to a darker, artifact-heavy feel reminiscent of the preceding blocks. The atmosphere was oppressive, reflecting the imminent invasion of Dominaria.

### Key Mechanics of Nemesis

*   **Fading:** The signature keyword of *Nemesis*, Fading was a drawback mechanic that provided powerful, undercosted permanents that deteriorated over time. Creatures and enchantments entered the battlefield with a set number of "fade counters," and players had to remove one counter during their upkeep. When the last counter was removed, the permanent was sacrificed. This provided highly aggressive strategies for tournament play, rewarding early tempo rather than long-term resilience.
*   **Planeshifted Cards:** A unique design decision, certain cards in *Nemesis* were reprints or functional reprints of cards from older, often expensive, sets (like *Alpha* or *Antiquities*), but with new art and flavor text referencing Rath. This was a nod to the game's history and helped showcase the power difference between the two planes.
*   **Contamination/Cumulative Upkeep:** While not a new mechanic, *Nemesis* featured several prominent cards utilizing Cumulative Upkeep, forcing players to pay increasingly larger amounts of mana or resources to keep a powerful permanent on the field.

The intensity of *Nemesis* effectively built the dread and urgency required for the third and final chapter.

## Set Three: Prophecy (June 2000) – The Eve of Invasion

*Prophecy* concludes the Masques Cycle, bringing the scattered threads of the saga together on the ravaged plane of Dominaria. Gerrard has returned to his homeland, though he faces political instability and the existential threat of the Phyrexian Invasion looming. The set focuses heavily on the deteriorating condition of Dominaria, the desperation of the native population, and the internal struggle for leadership before the main war begins.

Historically, *Prophecy* is often cited as the weakest set of the cycle, primarily due to an experimental design element that proved unpopular: the heavy emphasis on land and global effects that punished players for using too many creatures or drawing too much mana.

### Key Mechanics of Prophecy

*   **Rhystic Spells:** The most defining mechanic of *Prophecy*. Rhystic spells could be cast for a cheaper mana cost but came with a built-D tax. If an opponent was willing to pay an additional cost (usually 1 generic mana) when the spell was cast, the Rhystic spell would be countered or its effect negated. These cards were generally confusing and slow in competitive play, leading to complex stack interactions.
*   **Land Matters:** Many cards in *Prophecy* had abilities that scaled with the number of lands a player controlled, or punished players who tapped out for spells. This was an attempt to shift the focus from the creature-heavy formats of the time but often led to stagnant board states.
*   **Avatar Cycle:** Prophecy featured a cycle of powerful, high-cost Legendary Avatars (e.g., [[Avatar of Woe]]) that had cost reductions based on fulfilling certain board conditions, rewarding players who were losing or meeting specific criteria.

While mechanically controversial, *Prophecy* completed the narrative requirements: Gerrard solidified his position, the *Weatherlight* was ready, and the threat of Phyrexia was immediate, setting the stage perfectly for the massive war that would define the next block.

## The Enduring Legacy of the Masques Block MTG

The Masques Cycle provided far more than just three sets of cards. It gave MTG players:

1.  **Narrative Tension:** It successfully bridged the gap between the complex historical backstory of Urza and the all-out conflict of the Invasion Block.
2.  **Mechanic Innovation:** It introduced Rebels/Mercenaries and Fading, both of which have been occasionally referenced or re-imagined in subsequent MTG sets (though Rhystic has largely been abandoned).
3.  **The Reserved List Turning Point:** By explicitly excluding *Mercadian Masques* and all future sets from the Reserved List, this cycle cemented its role as a monumental financial and policy marker in the history of the game.

The Masques Cycle is a testament to the versatility of Magic: The Gathering—a series of sets that challenged player expectations, redefined reprint policy, and skillfully moved the greatest narrative arc in MTG history closer to its devastating conclusion. Whether you call it the Masques Cycle or the **Masques Block MTG**, its importance cannot be overstated.
