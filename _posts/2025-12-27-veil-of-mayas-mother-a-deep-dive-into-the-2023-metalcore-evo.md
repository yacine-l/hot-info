## CONTENT

<p>Few bands in the modern metal scene can claim the kind of sustained evolution and genre mastery that defines Veil of Maya. Emerging from the highly technical deathcore trenches, the Chicago-based quartet has consistently pushed its boundaries, culminating in a discography that bridges blistering technicality with infectious, soaring melody. Their seventh studio album, simply titled **Mother**, stands as a landmark release—a definitive statement of purpose that solidifies the band’s position at the forefront of contemporary progressive metalcore.</p>

<p>Released on May 12, 2023, through the staunch support of Sumerian Records, *Mother* is not just another album; it is a meticulously crafted soundscape that synthesizes everything Veil of Maya has learned over nearly two decades. It represents the maturation of their sound, embracing the melodic structures introduced in previous efforts while refusing to abandon the crushing complexity that first defined them. This balance required not only expert performance but focused guidance, which came in the form of acclaimed producer, Zach Jones.</p>

## The Production Powerhouse: Zach Jones and the Sonic Landscape of *Mother*

<p>The technical caliber of a Veil of Maya album demands a producer who can handle extreme precision without sacrificing visceral impact. For *Mother*, the band enlisted the skills of **Zach Jones**, a collaboration that proved instrumental in delivering the album’s massive, clean, yet overwhelmingly powerful sound.</p>

<p>Jones, known for his ability to bring clarity and punch to aggressive genres, took the raw material and elevated it. Veil of Maya's instrumental core—Marc Okubo’s signature, often eight-string, riff work, Sam Applebaum’s dynamic drumming, and Daniel Hauser’s underpinning bass—is notoriously intricate. In the past, this technical density could sometimes lead to a sound mix that felt dense or overwhelming. Under Jones’s direction, every syncopated chug, every dizzying sweep, and every percussive hit is given defined space, allowing the listener to appreciate the complexity without losing the overall groove.</p>

<p>The production strategy employed on *Mother* focused heavily on maximizing the dynamic range. This is especially crucial for a band that swings rapidly between dissonant, rapid-fire deathcore sections and massive, arena-ready choruses. The low end is tight and seismic, while the high end retains the shimmering clarity necessary to showcase the subtle electronic and synth elements that have become integral to the VOM sound. Zach Jones didn't just record the album; he engineered the sound of a band finally comfortable in their multi-genre identity.</p>

## The Evolution to *Mother*: Charting the Seventh Album’s Significance

<p>The significance of *Mother* being the band’s seventh studio album cannot be overstated. For a band that spent its first decade focused strictly on technical deathcore, the introduction of clean vocals and a more traditional metalcore structure with 2015's *Matriarch* was a massive risk. *Mother* is the culmination of the decade following that initial stylistic shift, proving that VOM successfully integrated these new elements not as a gimmick, but as essential tools for modern songwriting.</p>

<p>The band’s career trajectory laid the foundation for the diversity found on the 2023 release:</p>
<ul>
    <li>**Early Technicality (2000s):** Records like *The Common Man's Collapse* established their legacy as deathcore innovators focused purely on extreme technical precision.</li>
    <li>**The Catalyst (*Matriarch*, 2015):** The introduction of vocalist Brandon Butler, who brought versatile cleans, fundamentally changing the band’s potential for melodic structure.</li>
    <li>**Refinement (*False Idol*, 2017 / *[Pre-Mother Single]*):** The years preceding *Mother* were spent perfecting the balance, ensuring melodic sections felt earned and heavy sections remained uncompromising.</li>
</ul>

<p>By the time *Mother* arrived, the expectations were clear: deliver complexity, but make it hook-driven. The album manages this feat by utilizing exceptional songwriting discipline. The technical guitar work, which is a hallmark of Marc Okubo, remains utterly dizzying, but it is now harnessed in service of memorable song structures rather than existing purely for its own sake.</p>

## Sonic Analysis: Bridging Technicality and Melodic Mastery

<p>The musical DNA of the **Veil of Maya Mother Album** is defined by its refusal to stick to a single formula. While the album is firmly rooted in metalcore, it freely incorporates elements of industrial, technical death metal, and modern synth-driven djent. The synergy between instrumentation and vocals is the strongest it has ever been.</p>

<p>One of the most noticeable characteristics of *Mother* is the use of dynamic, almost cinematic, introductions and breakdowns. Instead of relying solely on repetitive low-string chugs, the band employs complex rhythmic patterns and shifting time signatures that keep the listener constantly guessing. However, every bout of complexity is resolved by an undeniable melodic payoff.</p>

<p>Marc Okubo’s riffing throughout the record is a masterclass in modern heavy guitar. He navigates the eight-string fretboard with a fluency that blends sharp, percussive djent rhythms with sweeping, jazz-influenced lead lines. Crucially, the synths and electronic effects are no longer mere window dressing. They are woven into the structure, often providing the atmospheric tension that explodes into the heavy sections. This layering creates a depth of sound that previous VOM albums only hinted at.</p>

<p>The drumming of Sam Applebaum is the engine, providing the relentless power necessary for such shifting rhythmic landscapes. On *Mother*, Applebaum’s performance balances relentless blast beats—a nod to their deathcore origins—with innovative groove patterns that drive the album's most accessible moments. This versatility ensures that whether the band is delivering a brutal mosh-pit anthem or an emotionally charged mid-tempo track, the rhythm section is tight, complex, and propulsive.</p>

## The Voice of Modern Veil of Maya: Brandon Butler’s Range

<p>The successful execution of *Mother*'s ambitious sound hinges entirely on the versatility of vocalist Brandon Butler. Since joining the band, Butler has been tasked with fusing the band’s extreme history with their melodic future, a challenge he meets definitively on their seventh album.</p>

<p>On *Mother*, Butler showcases a vocal breadth that ranges from absolutely guttural screams and low growls—satisfying fans of their oldest material—to clean vocals delivered with a remarkable combination of power and emotional resonance. The transition between these styles is seamless, often occurring within the span of a single verse, highlighting the sophisticated structure of the tracks.</p>

<p>Key aspects of Butler’s performance on *Mother* include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>**Emotional Grit:** The clean vocals carry a palpable weight, often layered and harmonized to create huge, anthemic choruses that contrast perfectly with the instrumental chaos below.</li>
    <li>**Aggressive Clarity:** Even the screamed vocals are exceptionally clear, thanks in part to Zach Jones’s production, allowing listeners to track the themes and narrative threads woven throughout the songs.</li>
    <li>**Rhythmic Integration:** Butler uses his voice as an additional percussive instrument during technical sections, matching the syncopation of the guitars before breaking out into soaring, unforgettable hooks.</li>
</ul>

<p>This vocal mastery is the essential ingredient that elevates *Mother* above many of its contemporary metalcore peers. It allows Veil of Maya to execute songs that are heavy enough for the technical death metal circuit while being accessible and memorable enough for mainstream rock radio.</p>

## Thematic Density and Lyrical Depth

<p>While Veil of Maya has often focused on abstract themes, the songwriting on *Mother* leans into deep metaphorical territory, exploring concepts of creation, destruction, legacy, and the cyclical nature of experience. The album title itself suggests a foundational, primal force—whether it represents the planet, the origin of life, or a destructive cosmic entity—providing a fertile ground for the band's narrative.</p>

<p>The tracks on the album navigate complex lyrical themes, often touching upon technological fears and existential dread, themes that resonate deeply with the aggressive yet futuristic soundscapes created by the band. This intellectual weight gives the music longevity and encourages multiple listens to unpack the full meaning of the record.</p>

## *Mother* in Context: A Definitive 2023 Metal Release

<p>The release of **Veil of Maya Mother Album** on May 12, 2023, cemented the record's place as one of the most important metalcore releases of the year. It serves as a blueprint for how technical metal bands can mature and expand their audience without diluting their core aggression. For Sumerian Records, *Mother* represents the continued success of nurturing bands that constantly evolve and redefine their genre.</p>

<p>Ultimately, *Mother* is a statement of extreme confidence. It is the sound of a band that has experimented, risked backlash, and ultimately found its perfect stride. The collaboration with Zach Jones provided the sonic definition, while the band members delivered the most focused, dynamic, and undeniably heavy material of their career. *Mother* is heavy metal for the future—complex, aggressive, yet undeniably captivating.</p>](https://images.unsplash.com/featured/?**%20Veil%20of%20Maya%20Mother%20Album%0A%0A**)
