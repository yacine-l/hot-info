<p>Few documents hold the foundational significance for an entire civilization as the <strong>Codex Boturini</strong>. Often referred to by its full indigenous name, the <em>Tira de la Peregrinación de los Mexica</em> (The Strip of the Mexica Pilgrimage), this manuscript is more than just a historical map; it is the spiritual and political blueprint of the Aztec civilization.</p>

<p>The Codex Boturini chronicles the legendary, centuries-long journey of the Azteca people from their mythical, ancestral home of Aztlán, culminating in their eventual settlement in the Valley of Mexico and the founding of their magnificent capital, Tenochtitlán. This remarkable document is a testament to the sophistication of Aztec historiography and remains an indispensable resource for understanding the origins and identity of one of Mesoamerica’s most powerful empires.</p>

<p>For historians, archaeologists, and enthusiasts of indigenous culture, the Codex Boturini offers a rare window into the self-conception of the Mexica before the catastrophic arrival of the Spanish. Its unique style and clear narrative structure have cemented its place not just as a national treasure of Mexico, but as a critical piece of world heritage.</p>

<h2>Decoding the Pilgrimage: What is the Codex Boturini?</h2>

<p>To fully appreciate the narrative contained within the Codex Boturini, one must first understand its physical form. Unlike many European books bound in quire, the Codex Boturini is a <em>tira</em>, or strip, characteristic of indigenous Mesoamerican manuscripts. This format allowed for a continuous, linear narrative ideal for chronicling a chronological journey.</p>

<p>The original material of the codex is likely amate paper or deer skin, layered with a gesso base, though the current manuscript is preserved on a long strip of indigenous paper. It was designed as a screenfold, meaning it could be opened entirely, stretching out the complete history, or folded accordion-style for compact storage.</p>

<h3>A Fragmented History and Its Visual Structure</h3>
<p>Remarkably, the surviving fragment of the Codex Boturini measures approximately 549 centimeters (over 18 feet) in length and is organized into 18 distinct sections or plates. While it is likely the original codex was longer, the surviving portion captures the entirety of the migration from the moment the Mexica left Aztlán until they reached the vicinity of the Valley of Mexico.</p>

<p>The manuscript is painted in black ink (likely carbon soot) on the prepared surface, exhibiting a pure indigenous aesthetic untouched by later European artistic conventions. The narrative is driven by a unique visual language:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Footprints:</strong> The essential element. Black footprints connect one location glyph or event marker to the next, symbolizing movement, travel, and the relentless march of time across the landscape.</li>
    <li><strong>Year Counts:</strong> Each section is marked with the Aztec calendar year, allowing historians to establish a rough timeline for the migration, which spans approximately 200 years (from the year 1 Flint Knife, which scholars usually correlate to 1064 AD, to 1325 AD).</li>
    <li><strong>Place Glyphs and Person Glyphs:</strong> Stylized drawings represent specific cities, mountains, or historical figures. For instance, the image of Aztlán (Place of the Herons) is clearly marked by a small island or island-like city surrounded by water.</li>
</ul>

<p>The simplicity of the artwork belies the complexity of the historical information conveyed. The absence of color suggests that the codex may have been either unfinished or intended primarily as a historical register, where the narrative precision was more important than aesthetic flourish.</p>

<h2>The Spiritual Mandate: Why the Mexica Left Aztlán</h2>

<p>The narrative of the Codex Boturini does not begin with an administrative decision but with a divine command. According to Mexica cosmology recorded in the Tira, the migration was initiated by their patron deity, Huitzilopochtli (Hummingbird Left), the God of Sun, War, and Sacrifice.</p>

<p>Aztlán—a highly debated geographical location, often interpreted as a mythical "White Land" or "Place of Origin"—is depicted as a peaceful, prosperous, island community. The historical record suggests the Azteca were not the only group to leave Aztlán, but their specific journey was guided by the god who spoke through a bundle carried by the priests.</p>

<p>The journey itself was arduous, marked by various stops, conflicts, and pivotal moments of cultural development. Crucially, it was early in the pilgrimage that the people transitioned from being merely "Azteca" (people from Aztlán) to "Mexica" (a name derived from Mēxitl, one of Huitzilopochtli’s epithets, or perhaps signifying the centrality of the umbilical cord—the <em>mexi</em>—in Aztec thought). This change of name recorded in the Codex signifies a profound shift in identity, confirming their destiny as a chosen people.</p>

<h3>Key Episodes Documented in the Tira</h3>
<p>The <strong>Codex Boturini</strong> acts as a sequential map, detailing every stop the Mexica made while wandering the northern territories before entering the Valley of Mexico. Key locations and events documented include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Coatepec (Snake Mountain):</strong> An early stop where the Mexica attempted to settle permanently, indicating they were initially seeking a quick end to the journey. However, Huitzilopochtli demanded they continue their sacred pilgrimage.</li>
    <li><strong>Tollan-Xicocotitlan (Tula):</strong> The ruins of the former Toltec capital, which the Mexica observed. This stop helped establish the Mexica's ideological connection to previous great civilizations, bolstering their claim to legitimacy in the central valley.</li>
    <li><strong>Chapultepec (Grasshopper Hill):</strong> One of their final significant settlements before the foundation of the capital. It was here that they engaged in significant battles with surrounding city-states, demonstrating their growing military prowess and necessity for a definitive, defensible home.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Tira concludes just as the Mexica are entering a period of servitude under the dominant regional powers before their eventual, successful settlement in 1325 AD on a small island in Lake Texcoco—the site of the eagle perched on a nopal cactus, the sign given by Huitzilopochtli.</p>

<h2>The Collector and the Name: Lorenzo Boturini Benaduci</h2>

<p>The manuscript is known today not by its indigenous name, but by the name of the Italian nobleman who collected it: Lorenzo Boturini Benaduci. Boturini traveled to New Spain in the early 18th century (1736) with the explicit goal of documenting the history of the Virgin of Guadalupe and, more broadly, the history of the indigenous peoples. His immense efforts resulted in one of the most significant collections of Mesoamerican manuscripts ever compiled.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Spanish colonial government grew suspicious of Boturini’s research and confiscated his entire collection in 1743, deporting him back to Spain. Though Boturini never recovered the manuscripts, his meticulous cataloging and dedicated preservation ensured the survival of the <strong>Codex Boturini</strong> and dozens of other crucial documents. The codex retains his name as a tribute to his role in salvaging this essential piece of history.</p>

<h2>Dating the Boturini Codex: A Product of Pre-Conquest Thought</h2>

<p>While the exact date of manufacture is unknown, scholars generally place the creation of the Codex Boturini in a very narrow, crucial window: either immediately before the Spanish Conquest (1519) or in the years immediately following it, likely before 1530.</p>

<p>The strong argument for its pre-Conquest origin lies in its absolute fidelity to indigenous style. It completely lacks European influence—there are no Latin script annotations, no shading techniques, and no attempts to integrate Spanish calendar dates. This artistic purity suggests it was commissioned by the Mexica elite to serve as the definitive history and legitimize their claim to the lands of the Valley of Mexico.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the content was so foundational that it was used as a source text for later, colonial-era codices that did incorporate Spanish elements. At least two other major documents draw heavily from the content, style, and structure of the <strong>Codex Boturini</strong>, confirming its status as the original authoritative record of the migration:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>The Codex Mendoza:</strong> Commissioned by the Spanish viceroy in the 1540s, the first section of this codex details the Mexica migration, directly referencing the sequence and imagery of the Boturini.</li>
    <li><strong>The Codex Azcatitlan:</strong> While slightly more fragmented and visually detailed, the core narrative arc and the specific sequential order of events in the migration align perfectly with the Tira de la Peregrinación.</li>
</ol>

<h2>An Insignia of Identity: The Codex in Modern Mexico</h2>

<p>The historical importance of the Codex Boturini transcended its ancient use as a political document; it has become a central icon of Mexican national identity. The migration story is not merely history, but a mythic cornerstone that validates the claim of modern indigenous communities as the rightful inheritors of the Valley of Mexico.</p>

<p>Today, the original manuscript is one of the most protected documents housed in Mexico's repositories. Its symbolic significance is visually reinforced at the entrance of the Museo Nacional de Antropología (MNA) in Mexico City—one of the world's most important museums dedicated to Mesoamerican history.</p>

<p>Visitors approaching the MNA are greeted by a monumental stone carving based on the <strong>Codex Boturini</strong>. This depiction of the footprint path, the year counts, and the glyphs of the Mexica journey, serves as a powerful reminder: to understand modern Mexico, one must first trace the steps of its ancient founders documented in this sacred strip of paper.</p>

<p>The <strong>Codex Boturini</strong> is a vital link between the ephemeral past and the concrete present. It ensures that the story of the Mexica people—their divine mandate, their perseverance, and their ultimate triumph in founding Tenochtitlán—will continue to be honored and studied for generations to come.</p>
