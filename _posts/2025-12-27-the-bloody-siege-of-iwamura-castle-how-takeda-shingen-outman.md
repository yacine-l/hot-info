<h2>A Strategic Lull Before the Storm: Setting the Stage for the Siege of Iwamura Castle</h2>

<p>The year 1572 marked the zenith of Takeda Shingen’s ambition. Having spent decades consolidating power in Kai and Shinano Provinces, the formidable ‘Tiger of Kai’ finally initiated his grand strategy: the march towards Kyoto. This campaign, known to history as the Nishikawama Campaign, required meticulous planning, and it was not solely focused on the major engagement that would follow—the devastating Battle of Mikatagahara. Crucially, Shingen first needed to secure his eastern flank and sever the supply lines of his primary rival, Oda Nobunaga.</p>

<p>The target was Iwamura Castle (岩村城). Located deep in Eastern Mino Province, this mountaintop fortress was one of Oda Nobunaga’s critical outposts. Its capture was not merely a territorial gain; it was a necessary prelude that would distract Nobunaga, solidify Takeda control over the essential crossroads, and ultimately enable Shingen to face the Tokugawa/Oda alliance with confidence.</p>

<p>The ensuing conflict—the <a href="#siege-of-iwamura-castle-1572">Siege of Iwamura Castle</a>—is one of the most compelling, if less frequently discussed, military maneuvers of the Sengoku period. It featured fierce fighting, complicated political maneuvering, and perhaps most famously, a female castle lord (an <em>Onna Jōshu</em>) placed directly in the crosshairs of Takeda aggression.</p>

<h2>The Strategic Importance of Iwamura: Gateway to Mino</h2>

<p>Iwamura was geographically invaluable. As a high-elevation <em>yamashiro</em> (mountain castle), it dominated the mountainous region separating Takeda’s power base in Shinano from Oda’s core territories in Owari. Controlling Iwamura meant controlling the flow of goods, troops, and communication between these regions. For Takeda Shingen, its possession provided several immediate, vital advantages:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Flank Security:</strong> It prevented Oda Nobunaga from launching a flanking attack on Takeda forces as they pushed into Tōtōmi and Mikawa Provinces.</li>
    <li><strong>Supply Interruption:</strong> It blocked Oda’s ability to quickly reinforce his ally, Tokugawa Ieyasu, who was already under immense pressure further south.</li>
    <li><strong>Logistical Hub:</strong> It provided a northern base from which Takeda could coordinate operations against the central portion of Mino Province.</li>
</ul>

<p>In essence, the entire trajectory of Shingen’s campaign hinged on the swift and successful subjugation of Iwamura. If the siege failed, Takeda’s flank would be exposed, potentially rendering the subsequent Battle of Mikatagahara unsustainable, regardless of the outcome.</p>

<h2>The Defenders: The Toyama Clan and the Onna Jōshu</h2>

<p>Iwamura Castle was historically held by the powerful Toyama clan, who were nominally vassals of the Oda clan. The command structure at the castle in 1572 was complex, reflecting the fluid and often tragic political marriages that characterized the Sengoku Jidai.</p>

<p>The Castle Lord, Toyama Kagetō, had died shortly before the siege began, leaving the castle’s defense in the hands of his wife—Oda Nobunaga’s aunt (or according to some sources, his sister-in-law). Though the historical record rarely provides her personal name, she is remembered simply as Lady Toyama (or the Iwamura Lady), and she effectively became the *Onna Jōshu* (Female Castle Lord) during this critical period of transition.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the castle held a precious pawn: Toyama Kagetō and Lady Toyama’s infant son, Bōmaru. Nobunaga had already designated Bōmaru as the castle heir and arranged for his future adoption by his own son, Oda Katsunaga. This arrangement made Iwamura a deeply personal matter for Nobunaga, intertwining family honor with strategic necessity.</p>

<p>The actual military defense was led by senior Toyama retainers who were loyal to the Oda banner, but the presence of the female lord and the young heir complicated the typical military calculus. Takeda Shingen saw an opportunity not just for military force, but for psychological warfare.</p>

<h2>Akiyama Nobutomo and the Takeda Advance</h2>

<p>Takeda Shingen assigned the task of capturing the castle to one of his most trusted and capable generals: Akiyama Nobutomo, known as the "Tiger of Takeda" in Mino. Nobutomo arrived with a substantial force in August 1572, initiating skirmishes and establishing a strong perimeter around the mountain stronghold.</p>

<p>The siege quickly demonstrated that a direct assault would be costly. Iwamura Castle was robust, well-supplied, and situated to make any climbing assault suicidal. Akiyama Nobutomo understood that sheer brute force was inappropriate, especially given Shingen’s tight timeline for the main campaign pushing into Tōtōmi Province.</p>

<p>Instead, Nobutomo opted for a combination of prolonged starvation and sophisticated deception, targeting the emotional and political vulnerabilities of the defenders—the fate of the infant Bōmaru and the besieged Lady Toyama.</p>

<h2>The Siege and the Art of Deception</h2>

<p>As weeks turned into months, the pressure mounted on Iwamura’s garrison. The defenders bravely repelled initial probing attacks, but the castle’s supplies began to dwindle, and hope of swift relief from Oda Nobunaga faded as Nobunaga was simultaneously struggling to contain other Takeda movements.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1572, Akiyama Nobutomo opened negotiations. Recognizing the unique position of Lady Toyama, the Takeda general presented an offer that was irresistible to a noblewoman seeking to protect her family and retainers:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Safe Passage:</strong> All Toyama retainers and the garrison would be granted safe passage upon surrender.</li>
    <li><strong>Preservation of the Heir:</strong> Crucially, Nobutomo promised that the infant Bōmaru would be spared and treated honorably.</li>
    <li><strong>Political Union:</strong> In a move that shocked the Oda clan, Nobutomo proposed a political marriage: he would take Lady Toyama as his wife, thereby integrating the Toyama leadership directly into the Takeda family structure and ensuring the castle's stability.</li>
</ul>

<p>Faced with inevitable starvation and mindful of the responsibility to the young heir, Lady Toyama and the senior retainers accepted the terms. The gate of Iwamura Castle opened in the 11th month of 1572. The surrender marked a decisive victory for Takeda strategy and a humiliating betrayal for the Oda clan.</p>

<h2>The Immediate Aftermath and the Iwamura Betrayal</h2>

<p>Upon securing the castle, Akiyama Nobutomo upheld the marriage agreement with Lady Toyama, cementing the immediate Takeda claim. He then took possession of the strategic outpost and installed a Takeda garrison.</p>

<p>However, the fate of the young heir, Bōmaru, led to immediate and intense fury from Oda Nobunaga. As per the revised Takeda plan, Bōmaru was immediately sent to Kai Province as a hostage. This act, while perhaps politically pragmatic for the Takeda, violated the spirit, if not the precise letter, of the implied agreement that the heir would remain free or in a neutral capacity.</p>

<p>The capture of Iwamura was disastrous for Nobunaga. It meant that his forces had to dedicate significant resources to attempting to retake the castle, diverting troops that could have been used to reinforce Tokugawa Ieyasu. In fact, the very month Iwamura fell, Takeda Shingen delivered the crushing blow to the Oda-Tokugawa alliance at the Battle of Mikatagahara.</p>

<p>The events at Iwamura Castle proved that Takeda Shingen’s political acumen was just as sharp as his military strategy. The use of marriage and promises to turn one of Oda’s own family members against him was a masterful display of psychological warfare. Nobunaga's rage was palpable, but he was powerless to act immediately, bogged down by the aftermath of Mikatagahara and the complexity of his northern campaigns.</p>

<h2>The Dark End of the Iwamura Story (1575)</h2>

<p>While the 1572 siege was a victory for the Takeda, the story of Iwamura had a dark conclusion that reveals the severity of Oda Nobunaga's vengeance. Three years later, following the decisive Takeda defeat at the Battle of Nagashino in 1575, Oda Nobunaga was finally free to focus his fury on Iwamura.</p>

<p>Nobunaga's son, Oda Nobutada, led the counter-siege. Akiyama Nobutomo held out bravely, but without the support of the now-deceased Takeda Shingen, the castle’s defenses crumbled. When the Takeda garrison finally surrendered, hoping for the same clemency granted in 1572, Nobunaga showed no mercy.</p>

<p>Oda Nobunaga ordered the immediate and brutal execution of Akiyama Nobutomo and Lady Toyama. They were taken to the execution grounds at the Nagara River, displayed, and executed via crucifixion. The senior Takeda retainers were also massacred. This act of extreme retribution highlighted the humiliation Nobunaga felt over the initial surrender and the betrayal of his aunt/sister-in-law.</p>

<p>The siege and subsequent fall of Iwamura Castle in 1572, though a regional event, secured the most significant territorial gain for Takeda Shingen during his final campaign. It demonstrated his ability to dismantle his enemies not just through pitched battles, but through patient, calculated deception and political manipulation. The saga of the *Onna Jōshu* and the castle's fate remains a poignant reminder of the harsh realities and high stakes of the Sengoku Jidai.</p>
