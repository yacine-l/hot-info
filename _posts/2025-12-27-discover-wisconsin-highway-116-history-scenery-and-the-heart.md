<h2>Introduction to Wisconsin Highway 116: A Vital Connector</h2>

<p>State Trunk Highway 116 (STH 116) might not boast the lengthy mileage of an Interstate or the rugged drama of a Northwoods scenic byway, but this short, north–south route holds significant historical and geographical importance within East Central Wisconsin. Serving primarily as a critical link within Winnebago County, STH 116 neatly connects the unincorporated community of Waukau in the south to the historic settlement of Butte des Morts on the shores of its namesake lake to the north.</p>

<p>For travelers seeking a quiet, authentic slice of rural Wisconsin, a journey along STH 116 is highly recommended. It serves as a microcosm of the region—bridging agricultural lands with historic waterways, and connecting small-town life with the larger metropolitan influence of nearby Oshkosh. Established in the era when Wisconsin was rapidly expanding its network of state-maintained roadways, Highway 116 has maintained its designated route for decades, providing a steady and reliable path through some of the state's most fertile territory.</p>

<p>The primary function of this route is clear: to facilitate local commerce, commuting, and access between smaller communities nestled between larger highways like U.S. 41 and State Highway 44. While its total length is modest, the landscape it traverses is rich in history, especially concerning the early French trading posts and Native American settlements that defined the region’s identity long before Wisconsin achieved statehood.</p>

<h2>Geographic Footprint: East Central Wisconsin's Backbone</h2>

<p>Highway 116 is situated entirely within Winnebago County, an area renowned for its lakes, rivers, and rich soils fed by the Fox River system. The route’s orientation is distinctly north-south, running roughly parallel to the western shore of Lake Winnebago and the Fox River complex, though it stays inland enough to be bordered primarily by agricultural fields and scattered woodlots.</p>

<p>The starting point of STH 116 is in the south, near Waukau, where the route connects with other significant regional arteries. Waukau itself is a testament to early Wisconsin settlement, often characterized by its well-preserved historical architecture and quiet, community focus. As the route heads northward, it slices through fertile plains that are highly productive, making the drive particularly beautiful during the growing and harvesting seasons.</p>

<p>This geographic positioning is intentional. Early planners of the State Trunk Highway system prioritized connectivity between farming communities and transportation hubs. While today STH 116 primarily feeds into the modern road network, historically, its northbound trajectory was aimed squarely at reaching Lake Butte des Morts, a crucial waterway that served as a major artery for transportation, fishing, and trade for centuries.</p>

<h3>Key Geographic Features of the Route:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Agricultural Corridor:</strong> The majority of the drive is characterized by flat, open fields, showcasing Wisconsin’s dairy and grain farming heritage.</li>
    <li><strong>Hydrological Proximity:</strong> Although the highway is mostly rural, it remains very close to the Fox-Wolf River system, which heavily influenced the history and settlement patterns of the region.</li>
    <li><strong>Winnebago County Exclusivity:</strong> The route does not cross county lines, solidifying its role as a local and regional connector within Winnebago County.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Waukau: The Southern Gateway</h2>

<p>The southern terminus of STH 116 begins near the community of Waukau. While unincorporated today, Waukau has a history dating back to the mid-19th century and retains a strong sense of place. The community was originally a mill town, utilizing the power of the Waukau Creek, a tributary of the Fox River. This early industrial base allowed Waukau to thrive during Wisconsin’s formative years, cementing its importance as a local hub for the surrounding farming population.</p>

<p>Travelers starting their journey north on STH 116 from Waukau will often join the route after passing through or near neighboring highways such as STH 96. Waukau offers a tranquil starting point, characterized by older homes, well-established trees, and the quiet pace of life typical in unincorporated Wisconsin communities. Its relative isolation from the major industrial centers has allowed it to preserve a historical charm that is appealing to those seeking an escape from faster-paced urban environments.</p>

<h2>Butte des Morts: History and the Hill of the Dead</h2>

<p>The northern terminus of STH 116 ends dramatically near the community of Butte des Morts, situated along the northern bank of Lake Butte des Morts. The name itself—French for “Hill of the Dead”—suggests a deep and often somber history, largely tied to significant clashes between French explorers and Native American tribes in the 18th century, particularly the Fox Wars.</p>

<p>Butte des Morts was, and remains, an incredibly significant geographical and historical point. It sits strategically where the Fox River widens into Lake Butte des Morts, which in turn connects to Lake Winnebago. This confluence made it an essential portage point and trading location for centuries. The French established a trading post here, and later, the U.S. government used the location for treaty negotiations with various tribes.</p>

<p>As Highway 116 approaches this northern point, the landscape changes slightly, opening up to offer views or access points to the lake. The proximity to this major body of water means that the community of Butte des Morts is often associated with recreational activities:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fishing and Boating:</strong> Lake Butte des Morts is famous for its walleye, bass, and northern pike, drawing anglers from across the state.</li>
    <li><strong>Wildlife Viewing:</strong> The wetlands surrounding the lake are protected and provide crucial habitat for migratory birds and waterfowl.</li>
    <li><strong>Historical Markers:</strong> The area is dotted with historical markers commemorating the significant events that occurred near the "Hill of the Dead."</li>
</ul>
<p>The end of STH 116 near Butte des Morts acts as a gateway to the larger Fox River Valley infrastructure, including easy access to the city of Oshkosh just to the east, providing a contrast between the quiet rural drive and the hustle of a regional center.</p>

<h2>A Journey Through Time: The Historical Context of STH 116</h2>

<p>The existence of short State Trunk Highways like 116 is often a direct result of early 20th-century political and economic needs. Before the extensive development of the Interstate system in the 1950s and 60s, state highways were designed to ensure that even the smallest, most remote communities had guaranteed access to a major, state-maintained road.</p>

<p>STH 116 was designated to provide the farming families of Waukau and the surrounding townships a reliable, hard-surfaced route to reach the market and trading centers of the north, namely Butte des Morts and, by extension, Oshkosh. This infrastructure was critical for moving agricultural goods—whether produce, milk, or livestock—efficiently. Without these direct connecting routes, local economies would have stalled.</p>

<p>While the designation of STH 116 itself is a 20th-century affair, the pathway it follows likely predates the automobile entirely. Given the strategic importance of Butte des Morts as a waterway hub, the physical path between Waukau and the lake was almost certainly utilized as a Native American trail and later, a carriage and wagon road in the 19th century. Driving STH 116 today is, in essence, following one of the oldest established lines of movement in Winnebago County.</p>

<h2>STH 116 as a Scenic and Recreational Drive</h2>

<p>For the modern tourist, STH 116 offers a perfect example of a Wisconsin "heritage drive." It is not fast-paced; it invites drivers to slow down, observe the working landscape, and appreciate the subtle beauty of East Central Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The best time to travel STH 116 depends entirely on the traveler’s preference for scenery:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Spring:</strong> The fields are freshly plowed and seeded, offering stunning dark earth contrasts, and the nearby wetlands come alive with migrating birds.</li>
    <li><strong>Summer:</strong> The drive is dominated by high cornfields and green, lush pastures, giving a sense of intimate immersion into the agrarian heartland.</li>
    <li><strong>Autumn:</strong> Though the route is primarily agricultural, the occasional woodlot and roadside trees provide pockets of vibrant fall color, complemented by the sight of harvest activity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike major interstates, STH 116 has few, if any, modern commercial services directly on the route. This lack of development contributes to its charm, requiring travelers to plan their stops in Waukau, Butte des Morts, or the nearby City of Oshkosh.</p>

<h3>Nearby Attractions Accessible via STH 116:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The Fox River Trail System:</strong> Easily accessible from the northern end, offering hiking and biking opportunities.</li>
    <li><strong>EAA Aviation Museum (Oshkosh):</strong> Just a short distance away from the northern terminus, a world-class destination for aviation enthusiasts.</li>
    <li><strong>Lakefront Parks:</strong> The northern area near Butte des Morts provides several county parks for picnicking, boat launching, and enjoying the water.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Planning Your Journey on Wisconsin Highway 116</h2>

<p>While a complete drive along STH 116 can be accomplished in less than 30 minutes, it is best experienced as part of a larger tour of the Fox River Valley. Due to its strategic placement, it serves as an excellent alternative route for travelers looking to avoid congestion on US 41, especially when moving between southern Winnebago County and the areas immediately west of Oshkosh.</p>

<p>Travelers should note that STH 116 is a rural two-lane highway, generally well-maintained by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT). Standard safety precautions for rural driving apply, including being aware of farm equipment during planting and harvesting seasons, which move slower and may necessitate passing only when clear visibility is available.</p>

<p>For those interested in exploring the heritage of East Central Wisconsin, STH 116 is more than just a navigational tool—it is a preserved corridor of history. It offers a quiet, reflective path connecting the past economies of milling and trading at Waukau and Butte des Morts with the modern reality of the region, solidifying its status as a vital, though short, piece of the Wisconsin State Trunk Highway system.</p>
