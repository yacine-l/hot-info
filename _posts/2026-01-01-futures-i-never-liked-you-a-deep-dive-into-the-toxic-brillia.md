<h2>The Reign of King Pluto: Introducing Future’s I Never Liked You</h2>
    
    <p>Released on April 29, 2022, <em>I Never Liked You</em> is the ninth studio album from Atlanta’s undisputed Trap God, Future (Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn). This release, handled through Freebandz and Epic Records, marked a significant moment in the rapper’s discography—a project that managed to synthesize the melancholic toxicity, braggadocious flexing, and deeply emotional undertones that have defined his career, often earning him the moniker "King Pluto."</p>
    
    <p>Coming three years after his previous solo effort, <em>High Off Life</em>, <em>I Never Liked You</em> was highly anticipated. It delivered immediately on its promise, debuting atop the US Billboard 200 and proving that Future’s unique brand of nihilistic yet irresistible trap music had not lost any of its edge. The album’s commercial success was largely driven by its potent blend of Future’s signature vocal delivery and an incredible roster of production talent and A-list guest features.</p>
    
    <h2>The Sonic Landscape: Production Excellence and Signature Sound</h2>
    
    <p>Future’s success is intrinsically linked to the dark, hazy, and sometimes haunting soundscapes that underpin his lyrics. For <em>I Never Liked You</em>, he enlisted an arsenal of veteran beatmakers and rising stars, ensuring the project maintained the cinematic, high-stakes feel expected from a Future record.</p>
    
    <p>The core of the album’s sound leans heavily into the signature Atlanta trap wave—heavy 808s, filtered hi-hats, and synth melodies that evoke late nights and questionable decisions. Key production architects for this release included:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Southside:</strong> A frequent and essential collaborator, Southside (and his 808 Mafia imprint) provides the essential, menacing foundation for several tracks.</li>
        <li><strong>ATL Jacob:</strong> A breakout star in 2022, ATL Jacob contributed significantly, cementing his status as one of Future’s go-to producers for introspective yet hard-hitting material.</li>
        <li><strong>TM88:</strong> Known for crafting atmospheric, ethereal trap beats, TM88’s influence adds necessary depth and variety to the tracklist.</li>
        <li><strong>FnZ &amp; Taurus &amp; Wheezy:</strong> Providing crucial diversity, these producers helped Future explore different sonic textures while keeping the overall tone cohesive and focused.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The result is a sound that feels both familiar to long-time Future fans yet polished and updated for the current landscape, perfectly framing Future’s gravelly voice as he chronicles tales of luxury, heartbreak, and drug use.</p>
    
    <h2>The Star-Studded Lineup: Analyzing Key Collaborations</h2>
    
    <p>One of the defining elements of <em>I Never Liked You</em> is its robust and high-profile feature list. Future didn’t just seek out features; he strategically placed artists who would complement his style while amplifying the song’s commercial potential. The initial tracklist alone contained some of the biggest names in hip-hop and R&amp;B:</p>
    
    <h3>The Megahit: "Wait For U" (ft. Drake and Tems)</h3>
    
    <p>The undisputed centerpiece of the album, "Wait For U" instantly became a cultural touchstone and Future’s second song (following "Life Is Good") to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The track stands out for its unique structure, sampling the vocals of Nigerian singer <strong>Tems</strong>, whose smooth delivery provides a lush backdrop. <strong>Drake</strong>, another long-time collaborator, delivers a characteristically introspective verse about complicated loyalty, perfectly contrasting Future’s typically direct approach. The song successfully married R&amp;B smoothness with trap intensity, securing its status as one of 2022’s most ubiquitous hits.</p>
    
    <h3>The Controversial Duo: "Keep It Burning" (ft. Kanye West)</h3>
    
    <p>Following Future’s co-executive production role on Kanye West’s <em>Donda 2</em>, the two linked up again for "Keep It Burning." This track is a dark, relentless anthem driven by aggressive synths and a propulsive beat. Released amidst a period of intense public scrutiny for both artists, the collaboration felt raw and unfiltered, capturing the chaotic energy surrounding them at the time. Kanye’s verse, delivered with a forceful, chanting rhythm, merges seamlessly with Future’s signature delivery style, creating one of the album’s most memorable high-energy tracks.</p>
    
    <h3>Atlanta’s Finest: Young Thug and Gunna</h3>
    
    <p>Maintaining the Atlanta synergy, Future connected with fellow trap innovators <strong>Young Thug</strong> and <strong>Gunna</strong> on "For a Nut." This collaboration showcased the intricate rhyming styles and melodic flows synonymous with the trio, celebrating their collective dominance over the genre. Their inclusion reinforced the project's roots in the Georgia hip-hop scene, providing the authentic trap sound fans crave.</p>
    
    <h3>The Dark Horse Features</h3>
    
    <p>The album successfully utilized features to introduce different shades of intensity:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Kodak Black:</strong> Appearing on the haunting track "Voodoo," Kodak Black provided his characteristic street-focused narratives, adding a grittier edge to the album’s emotional core.</li>
        <li><strong>EST Gee:</strong> The Louisville rapper joined Future for "Chickens," delivering his tough, monotone style that contrasts sharply with Future’s melodic flows, making for a powerful combination of vulnerability and hardened street realism.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>The Immediate Follow-Up: The Deluxe Edition Deep Dive</h2>
    
    <p>Just three days after the initial release, Future surprised fans with a deluxe edition on May 2, 2022, adding six new tracks and expanding the roster of collaborations. This quick turnaround demonstrated Future’s commitment to saturating the market and capitalizing on the album's massive initial momentum.</p>
    
    <p>The deluxe tracks maintained the high production standards of the original, while showcasing a deeper commitment to collaboration with key figures in regional and mainstream hip-hop:</p>
    
    <h3>Expanding the Roster</h3>
    
    <p>The deluxe edition saw Future connecting with several highly respected names, each adding a unique dimension to the project:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Babyface Ray &amp; 42 Dugg:</strong> Future bridged the gap between Atlanta and Detroit, tapping into the emerging wave of Michigan street rap. Their contributions added a distinct, slightly darker lyrical focus to the bonus tracks.</li>
        <li><strong>Lil Durk &amp; Lil Baby:</strong> These two features further solidified the album’s commercial power, bringing two of the most popular mainstream rappers into Future’s orbit. Lil Baby’s appearance, in particular, was seen as a nod to the next generation of Atlanta superstars.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>A Final, Poignant Note: Remembering Young Scooter</h3>
    
    <p>Crucially, the deluxe edition included a feature from longtime Freebandz affiliate and Future’s frequent collaborator, <strong>Young Scooter</strong>. While not widely publicized at the time, his appearance on the track proved to be his final recorded contribution to a Future project before his untimely passing on March 28, 2025. This feature serves as a poignant reminder of the brotherhood and history within the Freebandz collective, cementing Young Scooter’s final musical legacy alongside Future.</p>
    
    <h2>Commercial and Critical Reception: Solidifying Future's Legacy</h2>
    
    <p><em>I Never Liked You</em> wasn’t just a commercial smash; it also garnered significant critical acclaim, praised for its consistency, vulnerability, and masterful execution of the trap subgenre. Reviewers highlighted Future’s mature lyricism—even while focusing on his signature "toxic" themes—and the expertly curated features.</p>
    
    <p>The album’s charting success was immediate and undeniable. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making Future only the sixth artist in history to have multiple albums debut at the top spot in the 2020s. Furthermore, the album produced four top-ten singles on the Billboard Hot 100, including the chart-topping "Wait For U," underscoring the project's pervasive cultural reach in 2022.</p>
    
    <h2>I Never Liked You: The Future Standard</h2>
    
    <p>Future’s ninth studio album, <em>I Never Liked You</em>, serves as a masterclass in modern trap music. It successfully delivered everything fans had come to expect from the Atlanta legend—dark beats, tales of hedonism and heartbreak, and an unshakeable confidence—while simultaneously pushing his commercial reach to new heights through strategic, high-impact collaborations.</p>
    
    <p>From the haunting production of ATL Jacob and Southside to the incredible magnetism of the Drake and Kanye West features, <em>I Never Liked You</em> is a benchmark for Future’s consistency, proving that after a decade in the game, King Pluto remains firmly on his throne, perpetually setting the standard for the genre he helped define.</p>
