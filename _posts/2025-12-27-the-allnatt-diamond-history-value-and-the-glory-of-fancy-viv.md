<h2>The Sun Captured in Stone: Introducing the Allnatt Diamond</h2>

<p>Few gemstones command the attention, admiration, and sheer historical weight of the world's most famous colored diamonds. Among these spectacular specimens, the <a href="#allnatt-diamond-history">Allnatt Diamond</a> stands out not just for its monumental size but for the unparalleled intensity of its hue. This magnificent gem is far more than a simple rock; it is a piece of art, geology, and history crystallized into a single, breathtaking object.</p>

<p>The Allnatt Diamond, a treasure in the annals of gemological history, measures an impressive <strong>101.29 carats</strong>. Its elegant shape, a classic cushion cut, is perfectly designed to maximize the brilliance and depth of its color. However, what truly elevates the Allnatt into the exclusive ranks of the world’s most elite stones is its official color grading: <strong>Fancy Vivid Yellow</strong>, awarded by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA).</p>

<p>This diamond is also unique because it is permanently linked to the life and legacy of its namesake, Major Alfred Ernest Allnatt—a figure known widely as a soldier, dedicated sportsman, generous art patron, and esteemed benefactor. The combination of a flawless geological masterpiece with a rich human story makes the Allnatt Diamond a truly fascinating subject of study.</p>

<p>In this detailed exploration, we delve into the characteristics that make the Allnatt Diamond famous, tracing its origins, understanding the rarity of its color grade, and exploring the impact of the man whose name it proudly bears.</p>

<h2>The Defining Characteristics: Size, Cut, and Color</h2>

<p>In the world of diamonds, value is determined by the four Cs: Carat, Cut, Clarity, and Color. The Allnatt Diamond excels in the first three, but its remarkable achievement in the final "C"—Color—is what places it in a class of its own.</p>

<h3>Carat Weight: Over 100 Carats of Pure Sunshine</h3>

<p>At 101.29 carats, the Allnatt crosses the significant 100-carat threshold, a benchmark reserved only for the largest and most historically important diamonds. To put this size in perspective, the average engagement ring diamond is less than 1 carat. A stone exceeding 100 carats requires a colossal rough diamond to begin with, meaning it likely originated from one of the richest kimberlite pipes in South Africa, historically the source of the world’s most famous large yellow diamonds.</p>

<h3>The Cushion Cut</h3>

<p>The Allnatt features a cushion cut, sometimes referred to as the "pillow cut." This specific style is a brilliant hybrid, combining the square-rectangle shape of a modern cut with the rounded corners and facet patterns of old mine cuts. The cushion cut is highly effective for colored diamonds because its large, open facets allow light to penetrate deeply, maximizing the saturation and distribution of color across the entire stone. For a Fancy Vivid Yellow diamond like the Allnatt, the cushion cut ensures every facet radiates pure, unadulterated color intensity.</p>

<h2>Fancy Vivid Yellow: The Pinnacle of Diamond Color Grading</h2>

<p>Standard white diamonds are graded on a scale from D (colorless) to Z (light yellow). However, colored diamonds, known as "fancy colors," are graded on an entirely different scale based on the intensity and saturation of their hue. The GIA color scale for yellow diamonds includes the following grades:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fancy Light Yellow</li>
    <li>Fancy Yellow</li>
    <li>Fancy Intense Yellow</li>
    <li>Fancy Deep Yellow / Fancy Dark Yellow</li>
    <li><strong>Fancy Vivid Yellow</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>Fancy Vivid Yellow</strong> designation applied to the Allnatt is the rarest and most sought-after grade for yellow diamonds. This grading signifies a saturation so intense and pure that the diamond glows with internal fire, resembling a drop of highly concentrated color. This extraordinary color is caused by trace amounts of nitrogen molecules trapped within the diamond’s crystal structure during formation millions of years ago. The more uniformly and densely these nitrogen atoms are grouped, the more intense the yellow color.</p>

<p>The rarity of this color classification is difficult to overstate. Of all diamonds found globally, only a minute fraction qualify as fancy colored, and only a fraction of *those* achieve the coveted "Vivid" classification. The Allnatt Diamond is therefore considered a masterpiece of nature, a color saturation rarely matched even by other famous yellow diamonds like the legendary Tiffany Yellow.</p>

<h2>A Journey from Mine to Museum: History and Provenance</h2>

<p>While the precise details of its discovery are sometimes debated, most historical accounts place the origin of the Allnatt Diamond in South Africa, arguably the world’s most significant source for large and intensely colored diamonds. It is believed the rough stone from which the Allnatt was cut weighed approximately 200 carats.</p>

<h3>The Early Ownership and Cutting</h3>

<p>The rough diamond was acquired in the 1950s and entrusted to a master cutter. The cutting process for a stone of this magnitude and rarity is highly specialized, requiring months, sometimes years, of planning to ensure the finished gem retains maximum weight while achieving the perfect balance of brilliance and color saturation. The resulting 101.29-carat finished stone quickly became famous within the diamond trade.</p>

<p>The diamond was eventually purchased by the renowned diamond house, the De Beers Group. It was De Beers who commissioned the famous jeweler Cartier to create a specific setting for the stone—a magnificent floral brooch, crafted in platinum, featuring five tiers of brilliant-cut white diamonds designed to complement and enhance the central yellow gem.</p>

<h2>The Namesake: Major Alfred Ernest Allnatt</h2>

<p>The diamond acquired its enduring name when it entered the private collection of Major Alfred Ernest Allnatt. Major Allnatt was much more than a wealthy collector; he was a highly respected figure in mid-20th-century Britain, known for his diverse interests and significant philanthropy.</p>

<p>Major Allnatt led a distinguished life that spanned military service, business, and extensive patronage of the arts. Born in 1889, he was known as:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>A Soldier:</strong> Serving in the military, earning him the title of Major.</li>
    <li><strong>A Sportsman:</strong> He had a deep appreciation for competitive sports.</li>
    <li><strong>An Art Patron:</strong> Crucially, Major Allnatt was a passionate collector and benefactor, donating significant works and funds to various museums and galleries, notably the Tate Gallery in London.</li>
    <li><strong>A Collector:</strong> His private collection was known for its quality and scope, and the yellow diamond became one of its most prominent features.</li>
</ul>

<p>His decision to acquire such a spectacular and unique diamond highlights his appreciation for beauty, rarity, and historical importance. Naming the stone after him permanently cemented his place in gemological history, ensuring his legacy extends beyond his philanthropic activities and into the world of legendary gemstones.</p>

<h2>Modern Valuation and Auction History</h2>

<p>In 1996, the Allnatt Diamond was brought back into the public eye when it was put up for auction by Christie’s in Geneva. At the time, it was still set in the magnificent Cartier-designed brooch. The auction attracted intense interest from collectors globally, recognizing the exceptional combination of size, cut, and the coveted Fancy Vivid Yellow color grade.</p>

<p>The diamond was acquired for approximately $3 million, a significant figure at the time, reflecting its extreme rarity. However, it is essential to note that the market for top-tier fancy colored diamonds has seen exponential growth since the late 1990s. Today, a 101.29-carat Fancy Vivid Yellow diamond would command a significantly higher price, easily reaching eight figures, based on the recent sales performance of similar elite colored stones.</p>

<p>Following its 1996 sale, the Allnatt Diamond was reportedly purchased by SIBA Corporation. It has been featured in several high-profile exhibitions since then, continuing to serve as an ambassador for the phenomenal beauty achievable in natural colored diamonds.</p>

<h2>The Enduring Legacy of the Allnatt Diamond</h2>

<p>The Allnatt Diamond is more than a metric of wealth or rarity; it is a testament to natural wonder. Its 101.29 carats of pure brilliance, meticulously shaped into a cushion cut, serve as the perfect vehicle for its defining feature: the breathtaking <strong>Fancy Vivid Yellow</strong> color. Named for a man who dedicated his life to service and patronage, the Allnatt Diamond carries forward both the history of the earth and the memory of a generous spirit.</p>

<p>For collectors, jewelers, and enthusiasts alike, the Allnatt remains a benchmark for excellence—a truly unforgettable diamond that embodies the very definition of dazzling luxury and historical importance.</p>
