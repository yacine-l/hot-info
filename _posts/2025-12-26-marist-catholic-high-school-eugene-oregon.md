<h1 id="marist-catholic-high-school">Marist Catholic High School (Eugene, Oregon)</h1>

<p><strong>Marist Catholic High School</strong> (often simply referred to as Marist) is a private, coeducational, college-preparatory Catholic high school located in Eugene, Oregon. Established in 1949, it serves the greater Lane County area and operates under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon. Distinguished by its adherence to the spirituality and educational principles of the Marist Brothers, the institution emphasizes a holistic approach to education, combining rigorous academics with deep spiritual formation and community service. Marist's enduring presence makes it a cornerstone of Catholic education in the Central Willamette Valley.</p>

<h2>Founding and Historical Context</h2>

<p>The establishment of a dedicated regional Catholic high school in Eugene was a post-World War II imperative. Prior to 1949, Catholic high school students attended local public institutions or traveled significant distances. The need for a centralized, faith-based educational option serving Eugene, Springfield, and surrounding communities spurred action from the local clergy and lay community.</p>

<p>Marist Catholic High School opened its doors in September 1949. Initially, the school was founded through a collaborative effort involving two distinct religious teaching orders: the <strong>Marist Brothers of the Schools</strong> (FMS), founded by St. Marcellin Champagnat, who provided male instruction, and the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary (SNJM), who provided instruction for female students. This dual-order foundation laid the groundwork for the school’s coeducational structure.</p>

<p>The school's foundational principles quickly aligned with the Marist Charism, prioritizing "education in the way of Mary" and emphasizing five key characteristics: love of work, humility, simplicity, family spirit, and presence. While the religious orders gradually transitioned away from daily administration, the Marist name and spiritual focus remain central to the school’s identity, with lay administrators continuing the tradition of the Marist Brothers.</p>

<p>Through the decades, Marist has undergone several significant campus expansions and modernization efforts, particularly in the 1990s and early 2000s, to accommodate growing enrollment and maintain high standards in science and technology education.</p>

<h2>The Marist Charism and Mission</h2>

<p>Marist Catholic High School operates under the motto, <em>Filius Dei Filius Virginis</em> (Son of God, Son of the Virgin), reflecting its dedication to the Virgin Mary as a model of faith and discipleship. The school’s mission is centered on educating students to become "Good Christians and Good Citizens," a direct quote from St. Marcellin Champagnat.</p>

<h3>Core Educational Philosophy</h3>
