        <h2>History and the Marist Legacy</h2>
        <h3>Founding and Early Years (1949–1960s)</h3>
        <p>The history of Marist Catholic High School began with the vision of providing accessible, high-quality Catholic secondary education in the growing city of Eugene. The school was officially founded and opened in 1949 by the Marist Fathers (Society of Mary), an international Catholic religious congregation known for its devotion to education and missionary work. The original campus was constructed to accommodate the increasing number of Catholic families moving into the region post-World War II.</p>
        <p>Initially, Marist High School operated as two distinct entities on the same campus: St. Francis High School, which served young women, and Marist High School, which educated young men. This dual structure allowed for distinct gender-specific programming while maintaining a unified administration and campus location. In 1968, reflecting national trends in Catholic education and population shifts, the two schools formally merged into a single, fully co-educational institution known thereafter simply as Marist Catholic High School. This consolidation cemented the school’s commitment to providing a single, unified educational experience for all students in the area.</p>

        <h3>The Influence of the Marist Brothers</h3>
        <p>While the school is administered by the Archdiocese of Portland, its founding charism draws heavily from the traditions of the Society of Mary. The Marist spirit is characterized by simplicity, humility, and a strong sense of community, modeled after the life of Mary, the mother of Jesus. This spiritual heritage is deeply embedded in the school’s daily life, influencing everything from retreat programs to community service expectations. The tradition emphasizes accessible education for all socio-economic backgrounds, fostering a welcoming and rigorous environment where students are encouraged to be "good citizens and good Christians."</p>
