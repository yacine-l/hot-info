<section id="history-and-founding">
<h2>The Foundation and Historical Context of MCHS</h2>
<p>The establishment of Marist Catholic High School in the mid-20th century was the culmination of efforts by the Archdiocese of Portland and local Catholic parishes to consolidate and enhance secondary education in the Eugene-Springfield area. Prior to 1951, Catholic high school education was often handled in smaller, parish-based settings. Recognizing the need for a modern, centralized facility that could offer a comprehensive college preparatory curriculum, planning began in earnest.</p>

<p>Marist officially opened its doors in 1951, initially operating under the name of <strong>Central Catholic High School</strong>. It served as a vital link between the elementary parish schools and higher education. The original campus, situated north of downtown Eugene in the River Road area, reflected a forward-thinking approach to educational design at the time. The school’s name was later officially changed to Marist Catholic High School to honor the Marist influence and tradition within the broader Catholic educational landscape.</p>

<p>The early decades of Marist were characterized by steady growth, the establishment of robust athletic programs, and the cultivation of a strong sense of community. The Sisters of St. Mary of Oregon and later Diocesan priests and dedicated lay staff provided the initial educational leadership. Over the ensuing decades, Marist successfully navigated changes in population, pedagogy, and technology, consistently maintaining its commitment to academic excellence while reinforcing its core Catholic identity. Key historical milestones often involve campus expansion and improvements necessary to support a growing student body that typically draws from a wide geographic radius, including Florence, Cottage Grove, and Lebanon.</p>

<h2>The Marist Catholic Identity and Spiritual Mission</h2>
<p>At the heart of the Marist experience is its Catholic identity, which informs the school’s mission to educate the whole person—mind, body, and spirit. As a diocesan high school operating under the governance of the Archdiocese of Portland, MCHS integrates faith and values across all disciplines, not just in theology classes.</p>

<h3>Theological Curriculum and Retreat Program</h3>
<p>Theology is a required subject for all four years, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of scripture, morality, social justice, and church history. However, the spiritual growth extends far beyond the classroom. The school emphasizes robust retreat programming, considered foundational to the MCHS experience. The most well-known retreat program is the <strong>Kairos Retreat</strong>, a three-day, peer-led spiritual journey that encourages introspection, community bonding, and a deepened relationship with God. Participation in Kairos is a rite of passage for many upperclassmen, fostering profound spiritual and emotional maturity.</p>

<h3>Service and Social Justice</h3>
<p>Service is a non-negotiable component of graduation requirements at Marist. Students are required to dedicate a significant number of hours to community service projects, promoting a sense of social responsibility and direct engagement with issues of poverty, inequality, and human dignity. This commitment to Catholic social teaching ensures that students understand their role as global citizens and agents of positive change, fulfilling the school’s mission to develop compassionate leaders.</p>

<p>The school community regularly engages in school-wide liturgies, prayer services, and opportunities for Reconciliation, ensuring that the spiritual life of the student body remains vibrant and central to the school’s atmosphere. This dedication to spiritual formation ensures that Marist graduates leave the institution not only academically prepared but also ethically grounded.</p>
