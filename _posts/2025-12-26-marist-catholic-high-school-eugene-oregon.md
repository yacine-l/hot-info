    <h1>Marist Catholic High School (Eugene, Oregon)</h1>

    <p><strong>Marist Catholic High School</strong> is a private, coeducational, college-preparatory secondary school located in Eugene, Oregon, serving students from Lane County and the surrounding Willamette Valley region. Established in 1968, Marist is recognized for its rigorous academic curriculum, robust athletic programs, and commitment to integrating Catholic faith formation within a demanding scholastic environment. Although operated under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon, the school maintains a strong spiritual and pedagogical connection to the legacy and charism of the Marist Brothers, founded by Saint Marcellin Champagnat.</p>

    <p>As the primary Catholic high school serving the Eugene/Springfield metropolitan area, Marist plays a crucial role in providing faith-based education for students seeking high academic achievement coupled with moral and spiritual development. Its mission is deeply rooted in fostering a community of learners dedicated to service, justice, and leadership in the mold of Christ.</p>

    <h2>I. History and Founding</h2>

    <p>Catholic secondary education in Eugene has a complex history dating back to the early 20th century. Prior to the establishment of Marist, Catholic high school students were served by institutions linked to local parishes. The transition to a unified high school began in the mid-1960s, driven by the need for a consolidated, modern facility capable of serving a growing population efficiently.</p>

    <h3>Consolidation and Establishment</h3>
    <p>Marist Catholic High School was officially formed through the consolidation of two preceding parish-affiliated high schools: St. Mary’s High School and St. Francis High School. This merger was conceived to centralize resources and staff, ensuring the financial viability and academic strength of Catholic high school education in Lane County.</p>
    <p>The new school was officially established in 1968 on a dedicated campus located in West Eugene. The name "Marist" was chosen in tribute to the Marist Brothers (FMS - Fratres Maristae a Scholis), who had a significant historical presence in the Pacific Northwest and whose pedagogical traditions emphasized hard work, community presence, and Marian devotion. While the school is now staffed primarily by lay professionals, the Marist charism remains integral to its institutional culture.</p>
    <p>The physical campus has undergone multiple expansions and renovations since its founding, reflecting a continual commitment to upgrading facilities to meet the demands of modern college-preparatory education, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.</p>
