    <h1>Marist Catholic High School (Eugene, Oregon)</h1>

    <p><strong>Marist Catholic High School</strong> is a private, co-educational, college preparatory school located in Eugene, Oregon. Founded in 1951, Marist operates under the auspices of the Archdiocese of Portland and is deeply rooted in the educational tradition of the Marist Brothers of the Schools (FMS), an international religious congregation dedicated to the education of youth. Serving students from the Southern Willamette Valley, Marist emphasizes a holistic educational model integrating academic rigor, spiritual development, athletic excellence, and a strong commitment to service, all within the framework of the Catholic faith.</p>

    <p>As a key institution in Eugene’s educational landscape, Marist Catholic High School provides an environment designed to foster critical thinking, moral responsibility, and leadership. The school’s mascot is the Spartan, and its athletic teams compete in the Oregon School Activities Association (OSAA) at the 4A classification level, boasting a history of significant achievements both locally and statewide.</p>

    <h2>Historical Foundations and The Marist Legacy</h2>

    <p>The establishment of Marist Catholic High School emerged from a growing need for local, comprehensive Catholic secondary education in the Eugene area following World War II. Prior to its founding, Catholic students often had to travel significant distances for high school instruction. Recognizing this community need, the Diocese of Baker, which historically served the region, initiated the planning phase in the late 1940s.</p>

    <h3>The Founding in 1951</h3>
    <p>Marist officially opened its doors in September 1951, initially operating as an integrated facility providing education for both boys and girls, though managed by separate religious orders. The school was uniquely situated to be influenced by the Marist Brothers (an order founded by St. Marcellin Champagnat in 1817, France) who took responsibility for educating the young men. The presence of the Marist Brothers gave the institution its lasting name and its distinctive spiritual and educational charism. While the operational oversight transitioned fully to the Archdiocese and a lay administration over time, the fundamental principles instilled by the Brothers—such as presence, simplicity, and a family spirit—remain central to the school’s identity.</p>

    <h3>St. Marcellin Champagnat's Vision</h3>
    <p>The Marist charism is a defining characteristic of the school. It encourages educators to teach with a deep sense of commitment, imitating the virtues of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Key tenets of the Marist educational philosophy include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Presence:</strong> Being fully present to students, both physically and emotionally, fostering a deep relationship of trust.</li>
        <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Modeling honesty, transparency, and humility in daily interactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Family Spirit:</strong> Creating a warm, welcoming community where every student feels a sense of belonging and mutual responsibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Love of Work:</strong> Encouraging diligence, perseverance, and high standards in all academic and extracurricular pursuits.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These values are intentionally integrated into the curriculum, retreat programs, and administrative policies, ensuring that the legacy of the Marist Brothers continues to shape the student experience long after their direct administrative presence concluded.</p>

    <h2>Academic Excellence and College Preparation</h2>
