<h1>Marist Catholic High School (Eugene, Oregon)</h1>

<p><strong>Marist Catholic High School</strong> is a private, co-educational, college preparatory institution located in Eugene, Oregon. Serving the Catholic community of Lane County and surrounding areas, Marist is recognized for its rigorous academic standards, strong commitment to faith formation, and its adherence to the educational traditions established by the <a href="#MaristBrothers">Marist Brothers</a> (FMS), founded by St. Marcellin Champagnat. As a key secondary educational pillar within the Archdiocese of Portland, the school enrolls students from the 9th through 12th grades, guiding them toward collegiate success and ethical leadership.</p>

<p>Founded on principles of simplicity, family spirit, and the way of Mary, Marist Catholic High School emphasizes a holistic educational experience that balances intellectual growth with spiritual and physical development. The school’s mascot is the <strong>Spartan</strong>, symbolizing strength and discipline in academic and athletic endeavors.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Historical Context and Founding</h2>

<p>The establishment of Marist Catholic High School was a direct response to the growing need for Catholic secondary education in the Southern Willamette Valley following World War II. While the Sisters of the Holy Names had operated St. Mary’s High School in Eugene prior to 1950, the Diocese of Baker (which then encompassed Eugene) sought a stronger, permanent high school solution.</p>

<h3>The Arrival of the Marist Brothers</h3>

<p>Marist Catholic High School officially opened its doors in <strong>September 1949</strong>, initially located near St. Mary Catholic Church in Eugene. The school was entrusted to the <strong>Marist Brothers of the Schools</strong>, a religious congregation dedicated solely to the education and evangelization of youth. The Marist Brothers brought with them an internationally respected pedagogical approach rooted in the teachings of their founder, St. Marcellin Champagnat (1789–1840).</p>

<p>The school quickly outgrew its original downtown location, prompting a critical move to a larger, dedicated campus. In 1958, Marist relocated to its current expansive campus on Highway 99, designed to accommodate a larger student body and provide dedicated athletic fields and modern classrooms. This move solidified Marist's role as the central Catholic high school for Lane County, drawing students from Eugene, Springfield, Cottage Grove, and beyond.</p>

<h3>Growth and Transition</h3>

<p>The decades of the 1960s and 1970s saw significant growth in enrollment and facilities. During this period, the school was almost entirely staffed and administered by the Marist Brothers. However, like many religious orders in the late 20th century, the number of vocations began to decrease. By the 1980s, Marist began a strategic transition to lay administration and faculty, who were specifically trained and committed to upholding the Marist charism—ensuring that the core values and distinctive educational philosophy remained central to the school's mission.</p>

<p>Major renovations and expansion projects throughout the 1990s and 2000s modernized the campus, adding state-of-the-art science laboratories, an improved performing arts venue, and contemporary athletic facilities, ensuring Marist remained competitive among independent college preparatory schools in Oregon.</p>

<h2>The Marist Charism and Spiritual Life</h2>

<p>What uniquely defines Marist Catholic High School is its connection to the worldwide network of Marist Schools. The curriculum and community life are structured around the five core Marist characteristics, often referred to as the <strong>Marist Pillars</strong>:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Presence:</strong> Being fully present and attentive to students and their needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Living honestly, without pretense, and prioritizing genuine relationships.</li>
    <li><strong>Family Spirit:</strong> Creating a close-knit, supportive community where everyone feels valued and respected.</li>
    <li><strong>Love of Work:</strong> Encouraging diligence, perseverance, and service through action.</li>
    <li><strong>In the Way of Mary:</strong> Emulating Mary’s quiet strength, faith, and humility.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Faith Formation and Service</h3>
<p>As a Catholic institution, faith formation is integrated into all aspects of school life. Students are required to take four years of Theology courses, covering topics ranging from sacred scripture and church history to moral ethics and social justice. The curriculum emphasizes the application of Catholic Social Teaching (CST) to real-world issues.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Service Requirement:</strong> Every student must complete a significant number of annual <strong>community service hours</strong>. This requirement is viewed not merely as a graduation prerequisite but as a core component of forming socially responsible citizens committed to serving the "least favored" in society, a foundational tenet of the Marist Brothers’ mission.</li>
    <li><strong>Retreat Program:</strong> The school maintains a robust retreat program, including class-level specific retreats (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior) and the transformative, student-led senior retreat, often based on the Kairos model, designed to deepen personal faith and foster peer bonds.</li>
    <li><strong>Liturgical Life:</strong> School-wide Masses and prayer services are regularly held, centered around the Catholic liturgical calendar.</li>
