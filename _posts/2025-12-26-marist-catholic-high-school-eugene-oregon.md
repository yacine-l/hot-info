<h1>Marist Catholic High School (Eugene, Oregon)</h1>

<p>Marist Catholic High School is a private, co-educational, college-preparatory institution located in Eugene, Oregon. Serving students across the greater Lane County area, Marist operates under the auspices of the Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon and is spiritually guided by the traditions and charism of the Marist Brothers (FMS), founded by St. Marcellin Champagnat. Recognized as the primary Catholic secondary education provider in the Southern Willamette Valley, Marist emphasizes a holistic educational model integrating rigorous academics, spiritual development, community service, and extracurricular excellence. The school’s identity is defined by its core values of presence, simplicity, family spirit, and a commitment to educating students “in the way of Mary.”</p>

<h2>I. History and Foundation of Catholic Education in Eugene</h2>

<p>The establishment of Marist Catholic High School in 1968 marked a consolidation and revitalization of Catholic secondary education in Eugene. Prior to Marist, Catholic high school students in the area were primarily served by St. Francis High School, which had provided education since the mid-20th century. However, recognizing the need for a larger, modern facility to serve a growing Catholic population and integrate contemporary educational methodologies, the decision was made by the Archdiocese and local clergy to construct a new institution.</p>

<h3>The Role of the Marist Brothers</h3>

<p>The name "Marist" derives from the arrival and commitment of the Marist Brothers, a global congregation dedicated solely to the education and spiritual development of youth. The Brothers established a profound presence in Eugene, bringing with them a unique pedagogical approach centered on making Christ known and loved through the example of the Virgin Mary. The Marist Brothers provided administrative leadership, teaching staff, and a spiritual framework that shaped the school’s initial decades and continues to inform its mission today, even after the Brothers’ direct administrative role shifted to lay leadership.</p>

<p>Marist Catholic High School officially opened its doors for the 1968-1969 academic year on its current campus situated along the River Road corridor. The consolidation ensured the financial sustainability and academic excellence of Catholic high school education for the region. Over the subsequent decades, Marist evolved from a predominantly local institution into a regional preparatory school attracting students from numerous feeder parishes and public school districts throughout Lane, Douglas, and Linn counties.</p>

<h2>II. Academic Structure and College Preparatory Curriculum</h2>

<p>Marist Catholic High School maintains a demanding college-preparatory curriculum designed to ensure 100% of its graduates are qualified for post-secondary education. The academic program adheres to rigorous standards set by the State of Oregon and the Western Catholic Educational Association (WCEA), emphasizing critical thinking, effective communication, and intellectual curiosity.</p>

<h3>The Focus on STEM, Arts, and Religion (SMART)</h3>

<p>A signature element of the Marist academic structure is the emphasis on the integrated disciplines captured by the acronym <strong>SMART</strong>: Science, Math, Arts, Religion, and Technology. This model ensures a balanced educational experience, preparing students for fields traditionally dominated by STEM while underscoring the vital roles of ethics, creative expression, and spiritual development. Specialized labs and dedicated facilities support advanced coursework in physics, biology, and chemistry.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Advanced Placement (AP) Courses:</strong> Marist offers a robust selection of Advanced Placement courses across major disciplines, allowing students to earn college credit and experience college-level rigor. These typically include AP Calculus, AP English Literature, AP U.S. History, AP Biology, and AP Spanish.</li>
    <li><strong>Honors Program:</strong> Specialized honors tracks are available in freshman and sophomore years, providing accelerated instruction in core subjects before students move into the AP or college-level dual enrollment programs.</li>
    <li><strong>Graduation Requirements:</strong> Beyond standard state requirements, Marist mandates extensive coursework in theology (one course required each semester), foreign language proficiency, and documented community service hours, reflecting its dedication to global citizenship and spiritual formation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The academic success of Marist students is consistently reflected in high standardized test scores (SAT/ACT) and exceptional college acceptance rates. Graduates frequently matriculate to highly selective institutions both regionally and nationally, including major research universities, liberal arts colleges, and military academies.</p>

Students participate in annual retreats designed for spiritual growth and reflection, tailored to the specific needs of each grade level.</p>

<p>Service is a critical component of the Marist mission. The school mandates a minimum number of community service hours for graduation, encouraging students to actively engage with local non-profits, parish initiatives, and global causes. This focus on service learning aims to cultivate empathetic leaders dedicated to social justice and Catholic social teaching.</p>
