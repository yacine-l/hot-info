<h1 id="introduction">Marist Catholic High School (Eugene, Oregon)</h1>

<p><strong>Marist Catholic High School (MCHS)</strong> is a private, coeducational college preparatory institution located in Eugene, Oregon. Serving students primarily from Lane County and the broader Southern Willamette Valley, MCHS operates under the auspices of the Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon and is deeply rooted in the educational tradition established by the Marist Brothers (FMS), founded by St. Marcellin Champagnat in 1817. Since its inception in 1968, Marist has distinguished itself through a commitment to rigorous academics, robust extracurricular programs, and a spirituality that emphasizes service, simplicity, and family spirit.</p>

<p>As a key component of the Catholic educational landscape in Oregon, MCHS aims to prepare students not only for college success but also for lives of moral leadership and responsibility grounded in Catholic social teaching. The school is accredited by the Northwest Association of Accredited Schools (NAAS) and is renowned for its high matriculation rate into four-year universities.</p>

<h2 id="history">History and Founding of MCHS</h2>

<p>The establishment of Marist Catholic High School was a crucial development for the Catholic community in Eugene. Prior to 1968, local Catholic students seeking secondary education often attended public schools or traveled to institutions outside of Lane County. Recognizing the need for a dedicated Catholic high school, the Diocese of Baker (which served the area before the jurisdictional changes) spearheaded the effort.</p>

<p>The school officially opened its doors in the fall of 1968, initially housed in temporary facilities before moving to its permanent location at 1900 Kingsley Road. The founding mission drew heavily upon the pedagogical principles of the Marist Fathers and Brothers, who emphasize forming "Good Christians and Good Citizens." The school’s enduring ties to the Marist tradition ensure that the curriculum and student life are infused with the charism of St. Marcellin Champagnat, promoting a spirit of humility, commitment to work, and a profound love for Mary, the mother of Jesus.</p>

<p>Significant milestones in the school's history include continuous campus development, expansion of athletic facilities, and the steady growth of its endowment, which supports financial aid for students from diverse economic backgrounds. The transition from direct administration by religious orders to lay leadership, common in Catholic education, was handled carefully at Marist, preserving the core identity while adapting to contemporary educational needs.</p>

<h3 id="marist-charism">The Marist Charism: Four Pillars</h3>

<p>The unique spiritual foundation of Marist Catholic High School rests upon the core values propagated by the Marist Brothers, which guide interactions between students, faculty, and the broader community. These four foundational pillars are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Presence:</strong> Faculty and staff strive to be present to students, not just physically, but emotionally and spiritually, fostering relationships based on mutual respect and genuine care.</li>
    <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Encouraging honesty, openness, and authenticity in all dealings, reflecting a humble approach to life and learning.</li>
    <li><strong>Family Spirit:</strong> Cultivating a nurturing and inclusive environment where every individual is valued, and the school functions as a supportive, extended family.</li>
    <li><strong>Love of Work:</strong> Instilling a strong work ethic and a commitment to personal excellence, recognizing that dedication and perseverance are essential for growth.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="academics">Curriculum and Academic Excellence</h2>

<p>Marist Catholic High School operates on a rigorous college preparatory model designed to challenge students across a broad spectrum of disciplines. The curriculum balances core requirements in mathematics, science, English language arts, social studies, foreign language, and theology, ensuring that graduates are well-rounded and prepared for competitive university admissions.</p>

<h3 id="college-preparatory-programs">College Preparatory Programs</h3>
<p>MCHS offers a comprehensive array of courses, including numerous Advanced Placement (AP) courses across key subject areas such as Calculus, English Literature and Composition, US History, Biology, and Physics. The school maintains a strong commitment to dual-enrollment options, allowing students to earn college credit through partnerships with local universities and community colleges while still in high school.</p>

<p>A key focus area is the integration of technology and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education. Marist offers specialized robotics, engineering, and computer science tracks, recognizing the increasing demand for technological literacy in higher education and the professional world. Furthermore, the Humanitas curriculum emphasizes deep analysis of classical literature, philosophy, and history, fostering critical thinking and communication skills essential for success beyond high school.</p>

<p>Graduation requirements at Marist are intentionally set above the state minimums for Oregon, reflecting the school’s commitment to academic rigor. All students must successfully complete four years of theology, emphasizing the school’s primary mission to integrate faith and reason.</p>

<h3 id="student-support">Student Support and Counseling</h3>
<p>The academic program is supported by extensive college counseling and academic advising services. Counselors work individually with students beginning in the freshman year, guiding them through course selection, standardized test preparation (SAT/ACT), and the complex college application process.

These retreats are highly valued by the student body as moments of deep reflection and bonding.</li>
    <li><strong>Christian Service:</strong> Following the example of Christ and the Marist tradition of service to the marginalized, all students are required to complete a significant number of Christian Service hours prior to graduation. This requirement encourages students to actively engage with local and global communities, fostering a strong sense of social justice and charitable action. Projects often involve work with local non-profits, care facilities, and environmental clean-up efforts within Lane County.</li>
