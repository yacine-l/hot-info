<h1>Marist Catholic High School (Eugene, Oregon)</h1>

<p><strong>Marist Catholic High School</strong> is a private, coeducational secondary school located in Eugene, Oregon. Established in 1968, it serves as the primary Catholic high school for the greater Eugene-Springfield metropolitan area and the central Willamette Valley region. Marist operates under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon and is administered in the tradition of the Marist Brothers of the Schools (FMS), emphasizing college preparatory academics, spiritual formation, and service to the community. The school’s curriculum is rigorous, designed to prepare students for success in higher education, while its identity is deeply rooted in the five pillars of Marist spirituality.</p>

<h2>Historical Foundation and Consolidation</h2>

<p>The establishment of Marist Catholic High School represented a significant consolidation effort within the Catholic educational landscape of Lane County. Prior to its founding, Catholic secondary education in the area was provided by two smaller, segregated institutions: St. Mary’s High School for boys, and Eugene Catholic High School (often referred to as St. Francis High School) for girls, both located nearer to downtown Eugene. By the late 1960s, evolving demographics and financial constraints necessitated the creation of a single, unified, coeducational facility.</p>

<p>In 1968, the current campus was constructed in the Santa Clara neighborhood of West Eugene, enabling the merger of the two historic schools into Marist Catholic High School. The new institution was explicitly placed under the spiritual guidance and educational philosophy of the Marist Brothers, an international congregation founded by Saint Marcellin Champagnat in France in 1817. The Brothers brought a tradition of educational excellence characterized by personalized attention, community spirit, and strong moral grounding, ensuring that the new school maintained a clear Catholic identity while embracing a modern, comprehensive curriculum.</p>

<p>Over the subsequent decades, Marist evolved from a regional institution into a highly respected college preparatory school, continually updating its facilities and academic offerings to meet contemporary standards. While the direct daily administration by the Marist Brothers has evolved, their founding principles remain central to the school’s mission and culture.</p>

<h2>Catholic Identity and Marist Pillars</h2>

<p>Marist Catholic High School distinguishes itself through its commitment to the five core values, or "Pillars," established by the Marist Brothers. These principles guide all aspects of school life, from classroom instruction to extracurricular involvement:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Presence:</strong> The commitment of faculty and staff to being fully present and engaged with the students, fostering a welcoming and supportive atmosphere.</li>
    <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Encouraging honesty, openness, and authenticity in relationships and lifestyle.</li>
    <li><strong>Family Spirit:</strong> Cultivating a strong sense of community, mutual respect, and belonging among students, staff, and parents. This is often cited as the defining characteristic of the school environment.</li>
    <li><strong>Love of Work:</strong> Promoting diligence, effort, and perseverance, teaching students that labor done well is a form of service.</li>
    <li><strong>In the Way of Mary:</strong> Encouraging students to live with humility and faith, modeling the quiet strength and dedication of Mary, the mother of Jesus.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Spiritual Formation and Service</h3>
<p>Theology is a required component of the curriculum for all four years. Students are actively involved in the Campus Ministry program, which organizes mandatory service hours designed to instill a commitment to social justice and the marginalized. Retreat programs are integral to the spiritual development of the students, most notably the senior year <em>Kairos</em> retreat, a four-day experience focused on self-discovery and relationship with God, which is a significant rite of passage within the Marist community.</p>

<h2>Academics and Curriculum</h2>

<p>Marist Catholic High School maintains accreditation through the Northwest Accreditation Commission (NWAC) and is recognized by the Western Catholic Educational Association (WCEA). The academic program is explicitly college preparatory, requiring a demanding course load in core subjects, including mathematics, sciences, history, English language arts, theology, and foreign language.</p>

<h3>College Preparation and Advanced Placement</h3>
<p>Marist offers a robust selection of Advanced Placement (AP) courses, allowing students to earn college credit while in high school. Typical AP offerings include Calculus, English Language and Composition, English Literature, United States History, European History, Biology, Chemistry, and Spanish. Furthermore, the school frequently facilitates Dual Credit options through partnerships with local universities and community colleges, enabling students to gain further college exposure.</p>

<p>The school places a strong emphasis on STEM education, evidenced by dedicated science labs and robust offerings in technology and engineering principles. Graduates consistently achieve high college matriculation rates, enrolling in highly competitive institutions across the nation and globally. Guidance counseling is provided throughout all four years, focusing on academic planning, standardized testing preparation (SAT/ACT), and the comprehensive college application process.</p>

<h3>Humanities and Fine Arts</h3>
<p>While college readiness is paramount, the curriculum is balanced by a strong dedication to the liberal arts. The Fine Arts department includes competitive programs in instrumental music (band and orchestra), vocal music (choir), visual arts (drawing, painting, ceramics), and a highly regarded drama department that produces multiple theatrical performances annually. These programs are viewed not merely as electives but as essential components of holistic development, fostering creativity and collaborative skills.</p>
