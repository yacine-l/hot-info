<h1>Marist Catholic High School (Eugene, Oregon)</h1>

<p><strong>Marist Catholic High School</strong> is a private, coeducational, college-preparatory high school located in Eugene, Oregon. Established in 1968 through the consolidation of two earlier institutions, Marist serves students across Lane County and the broader Southern Willamette Valley, providing a rigorous academic experience integrated with a robust Catholic faith formation. The school operates under the guidance of the <abbr title="Society of Mary">Society of Mary</abbr> (Marist Fathers and Brothers) and is overseen by the Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon. Distinguished by its commitment to academic excellence, service, and spiritual development, Marist maintains a reputation as one of the premier private educational institutions in the region, adhering to the core tenets laid down by the Marist founder, Saint Marcellin Champagnat.</p>

<p>As a non-diocesan Catholic high school, Marist’s educational philosophy emphasizes developing the whole student—intellectually, spiritually, socially, and physically. Its curriculum is designed to ensure 100% college readiness, preparing students not only for admission to top universities but also for ethical leadership and meaningful contributions to society. The school is accredited by the Western Catholic Educational Association (WCEA) and Cognia (formerly AdvancED).</p>

<h2>Historical Foundation and Consolidation</h2>

<p>The history of Marist Catholic High School is intrinsically linked to the early establishment of Catholic education in Eugene. Prior to Marist's founding, two distinct institutions served the Catholic community:</p>

<h3>St. Francis High School (1939–1968)</h3>
<p>St. Francis High School was established in 1939, founded primarily by the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary (SNJM). It was a coeducational institution that provided secondary education for nearly three decades. St. Francis was central to the early post-Depression Catholic community in Eugene, emphasizing traditional instruction and strong moral development. As enrollment grew throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the need for larger, more modern facilities became evident.</p>

<h3>Eugene Catholic High School (1955–1968)</h3>
<p>A second institution, Eugene Catholic High School, was founded in 1955 to meet the growing demand for Catholic education, particularly in the emerging suburbs. While both schools thrived for a time, administrative and financial considerations, coupled with the desire for a unified, centralized campus capable of supporting advanced college-preparatory programs, led the Archdiocese and local parishes to propose a consolidation.</p>

<h3>The Merger and the New Campus (1968)</h3>
<p>In 1968, St. Francis and Eugene Catholic officially merged, creating Marist Catholic High School. The newly consolidated school relocated to a purpose-built, expansive campus at its current location at 1900 Hypo Loop. The establishment of the new school was entrusted to the <strong>Marist Fathers and Brothers (Society of Mary)</strong>, known internationally for their tradition of educational excellence and focus on Marian spirituality. This transition marked a new era for Catholic secondary education in the area, allowing Marist to immediately implement a more comprehensive and centralized curriculum, supported by state-of-the-art facilities for the time.</p>

<h2>The Marist Charism and Mission</h2>

<p>Marist Catholic High School is deeply rooted in the charism—or spiritual gifts and values—of the Marist tradition, established by <strong>Saint Marcellin Champagnat</strong> (1789–1840). The Marist mission is focused on educating youth, particularly those who are marginalized, and doing so "in the way of Mary"—characterized by humility, simplicity, and compassion. The identity of the school is defined by five key Marist Pillars:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Presence:</strong> Educators must be present and attentive to the needs of the students, fostering strong relational bonds.</li>
    <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> A commitment to honesty, humility, and transparency in all dealings.</li>
    <li><strong>Family Spirit:</strong> Creating a nurturing, inclusive environment where students feel welcomed and supported as members of a spiritual family.</li>
    <li><strong>Love of Work:</strong> Encouraging diligence, perseverance, and a strong work ethic as paths to both personal and communal success.</li>
    <li><strong>In the Way of Mary:</strong> Emulating the spiritual quietness, discernment, and strength of the Virgin Mary, serving as a model for faith and action.</li>
</ol>
<p>This mission translates into a strong emphasis on service learning, retreats, and integrated theological studies. Every student is required to complete a minimum number of service hours, connecting academic learning with real-world ethical responsibilities and commitment to social justice.</p>

<h2>Academics and Curriculum Excellence</h2>

<h3>College Preparatory Programs</h3>
<p>The academic structure is built around core requirements in English Language Arts, Mathematics (through Calculus), Science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), Social Studies, Theology, and World Languages (Spanish and Latin). Advanced Placement (AP) and Honors courses are offered across all major disciplines, allowing students to earn college credit while still in high school. Key academic distinctions include:</p>

    <li><strong>Counseling and College Placement:</strong> A dedicated college counseling department ensures individualized guidance through the application, financial aid, and scholarship processes, resulting in a near-perfect college acceptance rate.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technology Integration</h3>
<p>Marist employs a 1:1 technology program, ensuring that all students have access to modern digital learning tools. This integration is managed to enhance collaboration and critical thinking skills while maintaining a focus on responsible digital citizenship.</p>

<h2>Athletics: The Marist Spartans</h2>

<p>Athletics are a significant part of the Marist Catholic High School experience, emphasizing teamwork, discipline, and competitive spirit guided by ethical standards. The school’s athletic teams are known as the <strong>Spartans</strong>, and they compete in the Oregon School Activities Association (OSAA) at the 4A classification level.</p>
