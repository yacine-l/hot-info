<p>The projection of American air power relies on a sophisticated and often unseen infrastructure of support. While fighter jets and bombers capture the public imagination, the true lifeline of the U.S. Air Force—and a critical component of deterrence—is the tanker fleet. Few units exemplify the quiet dedication to this mission better than the **116th Air Refueling Squadron (ARS)**, a historically vital component of the Washington Air National Guard.</p>

<p>Operating out of the expansive **Fairchild Air Force Base** near Spokane, Washington, the 116th ARS spent decades mastering the art of the “High Road,” providing crucial aerial refueling capabilities across the globe. From the moment the unit was equipped with the reliable Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker in 1976 until the seismic shifts caused by Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) in 2005, the 116th maintained a state of perpetual readiness, ensuring that global missions never stalled for lack of fuel.</p>

<h2>The Genesis of the 116th Air Refueling Squadron</h2>

<p>The heritage of the 116th ARS is deeply intertwined with the history of the **141st Air Refueling Wing (ARW)**, the parent organization within the Washington Air National Guard. The Air National Guard structure allows these units to serve a crucial dual function: providing military assets and personnel to the federal mission while also being available for state-level emergencies and civil support operations.</p>

<p>The unit’s predecessor organizations had roots in fighter and reconnaissance missions, but the critical transition to the air refueling mission in the mid-1970s marked its defining era. The arrival of the KC-135 Stratotanker at Fairchild AFB cemented the unit's strategic importance, positioning the Washington Air Guard at the forefront of the nation's strategic command structure. This transition was a direct reflection of the U.S. military’s increasing reliance on global reach and rapid deployment capabilities—a mission that could only be executed with a robust tanker fleet.</p>

<p>The location of the 116th at Fairchild AFB—a base historically linked to Strategic Air Command (SAC) operations, dating back to B-52 and missile alert missions—only amplified its strategic value. The infrastructure, the airspace, and the operational culture of Fairchild made it the ideal home for a heavy-lift refueling squadron committed to long-haul missions.</p>

<h2>The Reign of the KC-135 Stratotanker (1976–2007)</h2>

<p>For more than three decades, the operational history of the **116th Air Refueling Squadron** was synonymous with the **KC-135 Stratotanker**. A military adaptation of the commercial Boeing 707 airframe, the KC-135 proved to be one of the most durable and adaptable military aircraft ever built. Its longevity provided an immense stability to the ARS mission set.</p>

<h3>The KC-135’s Indispensable Role</h3>
<p>The KC-135 is not merely a flying gas station; it is a force multiplier. By extending the range, payload, and endurance of virtually every combat and support aircraft in the U.S. inventory, the 116th ARS crew enabled a truly global presence. Whether refueling tactical fighters during trans-oceanic flights or topping off heavy bombers during large-scale exercises, the Stratotanker crews were the unsung heroes of air power projection.</p>

<p>The variants flown by the 116th over the years included several modernizations of the airframe, ensuring that despite the KC-135’s age, its avionics and engines remained capable of handling modern airspace requirements and fuel demands. Key missions undertaken by the squadron included:</p>

<ul>
    <li>**Contingency Operations:** Providing immediate refueling support for rapid deployment forces responding to international crises.</li>
    <li>**Air Bridge Support:** Establishing continuous, reliable air refueling tracks necessary to move fighter and cargo aircraft from the continental U.S. to overseas theaters of operation (e.g., Europe, the Pacific, and Southwest Asia).</li>
    <li>**Training and Readiness:** Supporting countless training exercises for active duty and reserve units, perfecting the complex aerial refueling procedure which requires extreme precision at high altitudes.</li>
    <li>**Homeland Defense:** Maintaining readiness to support North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) operations, often refueling alert interceptors defending U.S. airspace.</li>
</ul>

<p>The crews—pilots, navigators, and the crucial boom operators—who served with the **116th Air Refueling Squadron** were highly skilled specialists, often balancing civilian careers with intensive military training requirements. This hybrid model is a hallmark of the Air National Guard and contributes significantly to the unit's deep integration within the local Spokane community.</p>

<h2>Strategic Deployment and Global Reach</h2>

<p>While based in Washington state, the mission of the 116th ARS was inherently global. Throughout the late 20th and early 21st centuries, unit personnel and aircraft saw extensive deployment cycles supporting major international events and conflicts. They participated in every major operation requiring extended air assets.</p>

<p>The rigorous training cycle prepared them for operations in diverse and challenging environments. Personnel from the squadron routinely deployed to locations across Europe and the Pacific, maintaining ‘tanker task forces’ that ensured theater commanders had the required operational flexibility. The sustained support provided to the U.S. Central Command following the Gulf War and during the subsequent Global War on Terrorism demonstrated the squadron's unwavering reliability.</p>

<p>The ability of the **116th Air Refueling Squadron** to seamlessly integrate into active-duty operations underscores the fundamental effectiveness of the Air National Guard model. They were, in all practical terms, indistinguishable from their active-duty counterparts when performing federal missions, yet they brought the unique perspective and often longer institutional memory inherent in Guard units.</p>

<h2>The BRAC 2005 Watershed Moment</h2>

<p>The year 2007 marked a significant pivot point in the operational history of the **116th Air Refueling Squadron**. The catalyst for this change was the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission, a legislative process designed to optimize the Department of Defense’s footprint by eliminating excess capacity and realigning mission sets.</p>

<p>The BRAC 2005 process initiated a major redistribution of air assets across the Air Force and Air National Guard. For the 141st ARW and the 116th ARS at **Fairchild AFB**, the decision resulted in the reassignment of their beloved KC-135 Stratotankers. While the unit itself was not deactivated, the removal of its primary aircraft fundamentally changed its day-to-day operations and mission focus.</p>

<p>The loss of the KC-135s in 2007 was a bittersweet moment. It closed the chapter on 31 years of dedicated refueling service utilizing one of the most iconic aircraft in military aviation history.
