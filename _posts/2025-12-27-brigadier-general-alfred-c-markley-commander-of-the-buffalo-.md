<h2>The Unsung General: Alfred C. Markley and the Crucible of Command</h2>

<p>While the history books often spotlight figures like Theodore Roosevelt and Admiral Dewey when discussing the Spanish-American War, the success of the campaign relied heavily on the professionalism and bravery of career soldiers who bridged the gap between the Civil War and the 20th century. Among these crucial figures was Brigadier General Alfred Collins Markley (1843–1926), a man whose extensive military service spanned over four decades.</p>

<p>Markley’s legacy is rooted not just in his longevity, but in the highly successful command he held during the critical battles in Cuba in 1898. As Colonel of the 24th Infantry Regiment—one of the legendary African-American "Buffalo Soldier" units—he directed his men through the thickest fighting, ensuring their regiment’s distinction at the Battle of San Juan Hill and the subsequent Siege of Santiago. Markley represents the steadfast leadership that defined the U.S. Army’s emergence as a global power.</p>

<h2>From Pennsylvania to the Potomac: The Civil War Years</h2>

<p>Alfred Collins Markley was born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, in 1843. Like many young men of his generation, his life was irrevocably altered by the outbreak of the American Civil War. His military career began in earnest when he enlisted in the Union Army, providing him with the foundational experiences that would inform his command style for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>Markley’s early service established a record of reliability and competence. He served with distinction in various capacities, maneuvering through the bureaucratic and chaotic environment of wartime command. This initial conflict taught him the brutal realities of combat and the importance of discipline—lessons that would prove vital decades later when he led troops in the tropical humidity of Cuba.</p>

<h2>The Long Peace and the Frontier Army</h2>

<p>Following the conclusion of the Civil War, Markley chose to remain in the regular U.S. Army, a path many seasoned officers took as the nation turned its attention westward. This period, often called "The Long Peace," was anything but peaceful for the troops stationed on the frontier.</p>

<p>Markley spent years in continuous service, rising through the ranks slowly but steadily. This era of military life involved grueling campaigns against Native American tribes, maintaining order in the vast territories, and managing the logistical nightmares of supplying isolated posts. By the 1890s, Markley had reached the rank of Major and had solidified his reputation as an efficient, no-nonsense officer.</p>

<p>His deep understanding of troop management and logistical support prepared him perfectly for the next great challenge the nation would face:</p>

<ul>
    <li>**1865–1898:** Continuous duty across the frontier and various coastal installations.</li>
    <li>**Focus:** Discipline, supply chain management, and small-unit tactics.</li>
    <li>**Key Promotion:** Achieving Colonelcy just before the outbreak of the war with Spain.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Command of the 24th Infantry Regiment: Markley and the Buffalo Soldiers</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most historically significant aspect of Markley’s career was his command of the 24th U.S. Infantry Regiment. The 24th was one of the four all African-American regiments (alongside the 9th and 10th Cavalry and the 25th Infantry) that came to be known collectively as the “Buffalo Soldiers.”</p>

<p>While the enlisted men of the 24th were African American—soldiers who often faced profound institutional racism and were denied the recognition their white counterparts received—their officers, including Markley, were white. This dynamic required a unique style of command. Markley, like other commanders of Buffalo Soldier units, relied on absolute discipline, fairness, and a keen appreciation for the fighting quality of his troops.</p>

<p>By the time the Spanish-American War began in 1898, the 24th Infantry was one of the most experienced and well-regarded units in the entire U.S. Army, a testament to the decades of tough frontier service under leaders like Markley.</p>

<h3>The Call to War: Mobilization for Cuba</h3>

<p>When tensions escalated into war with Spain, the 24th Infantry was among the first units ordered to mobilize and ship out to the Caribbean. The destination was Cuba, where American forces planned to capture the strategically vital city of Santiago de Cuba.</p>

<p>The logistical challenges facing the invading force were immense: disorganized troop transport, insufficient supplies, and the daunting climate. Markley’s prior experience in managing rugged conditions proved invaluable in ensuring his regiment arrived in relatively good order. They landed at Daiquirí and proceeded toward the interior, ready to join the push against the Spanish defenses surrounding Santiago.</p>

<h2>The Assault on San Juan Heights: A Defining Moment</h2>

<p>The climax of the campaign came on July 1, 1898, with the coordinated assaults against the heavily fortified Spanish positions on San Juan Heights. This battle complex included two primary objectives: Kettle Hill and San Juan Hill.</p>

<p>The 24th Infantry was positioned within Major General Kent’s division, forming part of the main effort aimed directly at San Juan Hill. Due to congested jungle paths and poor staff work, the American forces arrived fragmented and exhausted beneath the steep slopes, exposed to blistering Spanish fire.</p>

<h3>The Regulars Lead the Way</h3>

<p>While popular memory often focuses exclusively on the charge of the 1st Volunteer Cavalry (the Rough Riders) led by Theodore Roosevelt, it was the professional regular army units—specifically the 6th, 9th, 13th, and Alfred C. Markley's 24th Infantry—that broke the Spanish line and secured the heights. The regular units provided the tactical discipline and staying power that ultimately decided the engagement.</p>

<p>Markley’s command played a crucial and often overlooked role in the success of the charge. The 24th Infantry advanced rapidly up the slope of San Juan Hill, providing heavy fire support and coordinating their movements under intense pressure. Eyewitness accounts confirmed the incredible bravery and determination of the African-American soldiers of the 24th. Historians note that the 24th and the 13th Infantry were the first to truly breach the main trench line atop San Juan Hill.</p>

<p>Markley, leading from the front, ensured that his regiment maintained cohesion during the chaos of the ascent. His decisive leadership helped secure a position that was fundamental to the American victory. The performance of the 24th Infantry under fire solidified their reputation as some of the finest fighting men in the U.S. Army, and Markley earned immense respect for his command during the battle.</p>

<h2>The Siege of Santiago and Post-War Recognition</h2>

<p>The Battle of San Juan Heights did not end the war, but it broke the back of the Spanish defenses. Markley and the 24th Infantry immediately transitioned into the difficult, weeks-long Siege of Santiago. The conditions during the siege were arguably worse than the battle itself, plagued by heat, disease (particularly yellow fever), and continuing intermittent Spanish fire.</p>

<p>Markley’s duties during this period involved maintaining troop morale and discipline while facing severe outbreaks of sickness, a necessary and often difficult administrative task. Spanish forces formally surrendered on July 17, 1898, effectively ending the conflict in Cuba.</p>

<p>Upon his return to the United States, Markley received the recognition his long and distinguished service warranted. He was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General in 1901. This promotion was a testament not only to his battlefield performance in Cuba but also to his reliable dedication throughout the preceding decades.</p>

<h3>Markley’s Career Highlights:</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
    <li>Served continuously from the Civil War through the Spanish-American War.</li>
    <li>Commander of the 24th U.S. Infantry Regiment (Buffalo Soldiers).</li>
    <li>Led the 24th in the decisive assault on San Juan Hill, July 1, 1898.</li>
    <li>Played a critical role in the subsequent Siege of Santiago.</li>
    <li>Appointed Brigadier General in 1901, shortly before retirement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Quiet Legacy of Command</h2>

<p>Brigadier General Alfred C. Markley retired from the U.S. Army shortly after achieving his final promotion, settling into a quiet life after a lifetime spent in uniform. He died in 1926, leaving behind a legacy defined by consistency, integrity, and command effectiveness.</p>

<p>Markley’s significance in American military history rests on two core pillars:</p>

<ol>
    <li>**The Bridge Builder:** He was one of the last career officers whose service bridged the immense tactical and political gap between the Union Army of the Civil War and the modern professional forces that fought in World War I.</li>
    <li>**Commander of the 24th:** His leadership during the Spanish-American War helped secure the reputation of the African-American regular regiments. By focusing on competence and results, Markley provided the environment in which the Buffalo Soldiers could demonstrate their unmatched valor on the international stage.</li>
</ol>

<p>While figures like Roosevelt captured the headlines of the day, it was the steadfast professionalism of generals like Alfred C. Markley, combined with the fierce determination of the regiments they commanded, that truly delivered victory in Cuba. His story is a vital chapter in understanding the professionalism and diversity of the late 19th-century American military establishment.</p>
