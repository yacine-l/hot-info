<p>The year 1917 marked the definitive end of the Russian monarchy, but it ushered in a period of intense instability rather than peace. Following the February Revolution, the Russian Republic was managed by the Provisional Government—a fragile, coalition administration struggling to maintain order while continuing a deeply unpopular war. This vacuum of power, characterized by widespread social unrest, economic collapse, and a desperate population, provided the perfect fertile ground for the most radical political faction: the Bolsheviks, led by the astute and uncompromising revolutionary, Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, better known as Vladimir Lenin.</p>

<p>The promise of “Peace, Land, and Bread” became the rallying cry that separated the Bolsheviks from their moderate socialist rivals. Under the fierce strategic direction of Lenin, the Bolshevik Party galvanized popular support, primarily among the Petrograd Soviets, factory workers, and disillusioned soldiers. The resulting shift in power, culminating in October 1917, was not merely a transition; it was a fundamental rupture with the past, establishing the world’s first self-proclaimed socialist state. Understanding the first decrees and structure of <strong>Vladimir Lenin's government</strong> is essential to grasping the trajectory of 20th-century history.</p>

<h2>The Collapse of the Provisional Government and the October Coup</h2>

<p>The Provisional Government’s fatal error was its insistence on prosecuting the First World War. By the autumn of 1917, the Russian military was decimated, and the economy was in ruins. Meanwhile, the Bolsheviks, effectively utilizing the structure of the Soviets (local workers’ councils), had built a parallel power structure ready to challenge the existing authority.</p>

<p>The seizure of power—dubbed the October Revolution—was less a mass popular uprising and more a meticulously planned military-political coup orchestrated primarily by Lenin and Leon Trotsky. On the night of October 25–26, 1917 (November 7th on the modern Gregorian calendar), Bolshevik forces, including the Red Guard, occupied key strategic points in Petrograd: railway stations, post offices, and, most famously, the Winter Palace, the seat of the Provisional Government.</p>

<p>The operation was swift and relatively bloodless in the capital. While moderate socialists debated procedures at the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets, Lenin dramatically declared that power had passed into the hands of the Soviets, meaning, effectively, into the hands of the Bolsheviks. The previous government was immediately declared overthrown, paving the way for the creation of an entirely new administrative structure designed to rule without compromise.</p>

<h2>The Birth of the Sovnarkom: Lenin Takes the Chair</h2>

<p>Upon seizing control, the Bolsheviks needed to replace the Provisional Government with an administration that could immediately enact their revolutionary agenda. The result was the formation of the Council of People's Commissars, known by its Russian acronym, Sovnarkom (<em>Soviet Narodnykh Komissarov</em>).</p>

<p>This body was the administrative engine of the new state. It consisted exclusively of Bolsheviks and was immediately tasked with executive and legislative power. The composition of the first Sovnarkom was a "Who's Who" of early Bolshevism:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Chairman:</strong> Vladimir Lenin (Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars)</li>
    <li><strong>Commissar for Foreign Affairs:</strong> Leon Trotsky</li>
    <li><strong>Commissar for Nationalities:</strong> Joseph Stalin</li>
    <li><strong>Commissar for War:</strong> Nikolai Podvoisky</li>
</ul>

<p>As the governing chairman, <strong>Vladimir Lenin's government</strong> was centralized and heavily reliant on his personal authority. Unlike previous administrations, the Sovnarkom did not operate through slow legislative debate; it ruled by decree. This system allowed for rapid, radical implementation of policies designed to dismantle the old Tsarist and capitalist structures and establish foundational socialist principles.</p>

<p>The establishment of the Sovnarkom effectively bypassed any remaining democratic processes that had been instituted after the February Revolution. Though elections for a Constituent Assembly had been scheduled, and indeed took place, the Bolsheviks dissolved the resulting Assembly in January 1918 after it failed to grant them a majority. This action cemented the Bolshevik commitment to single-party rule and their rejection of traditional parliamentary democracy in favor of what they termed the "dictatorship of the proletariat"—a dictatorship exercised ruthlessly by the Party leadership.</p>

<h2>Foundational Decrees: The Immediate Reshaping of Russia</h2>

<p>To consolidate power and fulfill the promises made during the revolution, Lenin’s Sovnarkom immediately issued several landmark decrees. These documents were not just policy statements; they were revolutionary acts that fundamentally altered the relationship between the state, the peasantry, the working class, and Russia’s colonial subjects.</p>

<h3>1. The Decree on Land (October 26, 1917)</h3>

<p>The most crucial and politically strategic decree was the nationalization of land. For centuries, the Russian peasantry—the overwhelming majority of the population—had suffered under the oppressive system of serfdom and subsequent land poverty. While moderate governments had stalled on land reform, <strong>Vladimir Lenin's government</strong> acted decisively.</p>

<p>The Decree on Land immediately confiscated all lands belonging to the Tsar, the nobility, the church, and large estate owners without compensation. It declared all land national property, intended for redistribution among the peasantry based on need. By enacting this decree, the Bolsheviks effectively legalized the land seizures that peasants were already undertaking independently throughout the countryside. This move neutralized the greatest source of rural discontent and secured vital, albeit temporary, support from the massive peasant population, ensuring that the new regime had the stability required to survive the ensuing Civil War.</p>

<h3>2. The Decree on Peace (October 26, 1917)</h3>

<p>Fulfilling the central promise of "Peace," the Sovnarkom immediately issued a decree calling for all belligerent powers to begin immediate negotiations for a democratic peace without annexations or indemnities. This move was a dramatic foreign policy departure that directly challenged the Western Allies. While it did not immediately stop the fighting, it signaled Lenin’s determination to withdraw Russia from the catastrophic conflict, culminating in the painful but necessary Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in early 1918.</p>

<h3>3. The Decree on the Rights of the Peoples of Russia (November 2, 1917)</h3>

<p>The Tsarist Empire had been known as a "prison of nations," suppressing the cultural and political rights of vast non-Russian populations stretching from Ukraine to Central Asia. To gain support and dismantle the old imperial structures, <strong>Lenin’s administration</strong> introduced radical policies concerning national identity.</p>

<p>The Decree on the Rights of the Peoples of Russia recognized the principle of national self-determination. This unprecedented measure granted all non-Russian nations the right to declare themselves independent and sovereign states. While this decree was partly a pragmatic move to destabilize areas controlled by anti-Bolshevik forces, it also led to the immediate secession of nations like Finland, and temporary independence declarations in the Baltic states and Ukraine. The long-term goal for the Bolsheviks was, however, to eventually reincorporate these territories into a unified socialist federation based on shared ideology, rather than imperial coercion.</p>

<h3>4. Labour Rights and Education Reform</h3>

<p>The Sovnarkom also moved swiftly to address the demands of the urban working class, the core base of Bolshevik support. Decrees introduced significant improvements to labour rights:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The establishment of an eight-hour workday and a 48-hour work week.</li>
    <li>Introduction of comprehensive social insurance programs (unemployment, sickness benefits).</li>
    <li>Recognition of workers’ control over production, although this was later centralized under state control as revolutionary chaos subsided.</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, the government aggressively targeted illiteracy, viewing universal education as a cornerstone of socialist development and a tool for ideological indoctrination. Access to education was dramatically increased, opening up universities and schools to workers and peasants who had previously been excluded. This commitment to mass education was one of the most successful and enduring aspects of the early Soviet government.</p>

<h2>Governing by Decree: Centralization and Revolutionary Control</h2>

<p>The ability of <strong>Vladimir Lenin’s government</strong> to rule by decree allowed for unparalleled speed in societal restructuring. However, this revolutionary pace demanded the elimination of opposition. As the initial enthusiasm of the revolution waned and counter-revolutionary forces began to organize (leading to the devastating Russian Civil War), the Sovnarkom transitioned quickly from a revolutionary administration to a highly centralized, authoritarian machine.</p>

<p>The suppression of dissent began almost immediately with the establishment of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission (Cheka) in December 1917. The Cheka was the state security organization tasked with rooting out counter-revolution. Operating outside the bounds of traditional law, the Cheka became the primary instrument of the Red Terror, marking the beginning of the political violence that would characterize the entire history of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>By relying entirely on decrees, bypassing existing legislative norms, dissolving the Constituent Assembly, and using state terror against enemies—both real and perceived—Lenin cemented the principle that revolutionary success was paramount, even at the expense of previously promised political freedoms. This blend of radical social reform and political authoritarianism defined the foundational character of the Soviet state.</p>

<h2>Legacy of the First Administration</h2>

<p>The two years following the October Revolution were a period of intense crisis, foreign intervention, and civil war, yet the initial structure put in place by <strong>Vladimir Lenin's government</strong> proved remarkably resilient. The Sovnarkom successfully harnessed the immediate grievances of the Russian masses—the hunger for land, the demand for peace, and the desire for social justice—to survive the brutal period of civil strife.</p>

<p>Lenin’s administration fundamentally dismantled the existing socio-economic order. While the ultimate realization of their socialist ideals would lead to decades of hardship and repression, the initial decrees set into motion the processes that transformed Russia from a feudal agrarian empire into an industrialized, centralized power. The Bolshevik coup and the subsequent formation of the Sovnarkom remain one of the most decisive moments in modern political history, forever altering the geopolitical landscape and establishing the first successful model of a totalitarian single-party state dedicated to global revolution.</p>
