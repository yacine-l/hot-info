<h2>Getting to the Heart of the Matter: Barbara Mandrell in 1985</h2>

<p>The year 1985 was a pivotal moment for country music, balancing traditional roots with the polished sheen of the developing pop-country crossover sound. At the center of this transition stood one of the genre’s most versatile and beloved superstars, Barbara Mandrell. Following an incredibly difficult period of personal recovery, Mandrell delivered her sixteenth solo studio album, <strong><em>Get to the Heart</em></strong>. Released in August 1985 on MCA Records, and helmed by her long-time collaborator Tom Collins, this album was not just another entry in her prolific discography; it was a statement of resilience and an embrace of the future sound of Nashville.</p>

<p><strong><em>Get to the Heart</em></strong> served as Mandrell's first full solo studio offering since 1984's <em>Clean Cut</em>. While <em>Clean Cut</em> offered a transitionary period, it was the 1985 release that truly solidified her direction following a major life event—a severe car accident in late 1984 that halted her career and forced a deep personal reassessment. For fans and critics alike, this new music was deeply anticipated. It demonstrated that the dynamic performer, known for her incredible multi-instrumental skills and powerful vocal delivery, was back, not just surviving, but thriving.</p>

<p>This article dives deep into the making, sound, and lasting legacy of <strong>Barbara Mandrell’s <em>Get to the Heart</em></strong>. We explore the powerful production decisions made by Tom Collins, analyze the three successful singles the album spawned, and place this crucial 1985 release firmly within the history of modern country music.</p>

<h2>The Context of 1985: A New Chapter for Mandrell</h2>

<p>To understand the depth and importance of <strong><em>Get to the Heart</em></strong>, one must first recognize the dramatic events preceding its release. Barbara Mandrell was arguably at the peak of her mainstream fame in the early 1980s, hosting a successful television variety show and consistently dominating the charts. However, an unexpected and devastating car crash in September 1984 forced her into a lengthy physical and emotional recovery. This event dramatically shifted her perspective and, consequently, the tone of her subsequent work.</p>

<p>When Mandrell returned to the studio to work on the tracks for <strong><em>Get to the Heart</em></strong>, the music carried a weight of earned vulnerability. While the preceding album, <em>Clean Cut</em>, had established her commitment to a more streamlined, contemporary sound—a necessity for staying relevant in the increasingly polished 80s music landscape—it was <strong><em>Get to the Heart</em></strong> that truly integrated her personal journey with that polished sound. The resilience inherent in the title track and the overall collection resonated profoundly with her dedicated fanbase who had followed her recovery in the public eye.</p>

<p>The record industry in 1985 was hungry for mature country artists who could successfully navigate the waters between traditional instrumentation and the emerging synth and drum machine sounds popular in pop music. <strong>Barbara Mandrell</strong> was uniquely equipped to handle this blend, positioning <strong><em>Get to the Heart</em></strong> as a crucial benchmark for how veteran artists could maintain authenticity while embracing modern production techniques under the MCA Records banner.</p>

<h2>Production and Vision: The Tom Collins Connection</h2>

<p>The success of many of <strong>Barbara Mandrell’s</strong> biggest hits cannot be discussed without acknowledging the pivotal role of producer Tom Collins. Collins, a towering figure in Nashville production during the 1970s and 1980s, maintained a consistent and highly successful creative partnership with Mandrell. For the <strong><em>Get to the Heart</em></strong> album, their collaboration proved indispensable, shaping a record that was contemporary yet distinctly Mandrell.</p>

<p>Collins was known for his ability to layer intricate arrangements without losing the emotional core of a song. On the 1985 release, he utilized the evolving capabilities of studio technology. The production featured smooth harmonies, powerful backbeats, and the strategic use of synthesizers that defined mid-80s country-pop, moving further away from the funk-infused R&amp;B elements that characterized some of her earlier work. This sound was tailor-made for crossover appeal, aiming for rotation not just on country radio but on adult contemporary stations as well.</p>

<p>The sonic architecture of <strong><em>Get to the Heart</em></strong> reflects a conscious decision by both Mandrell and Collins to produce music that was clean, highly melodic, and radio-friendly. They managed to create an album that felt intensely personal—drawing on Mandrell’s strength and emotional depth—while sounding commercially accessible. This delicate balance ensured that the album, her sixteenth solo studio effort, stood out in a crowded marketplace. The consistency of their partnership allowed them to take calculated risks on new musical trends while remaining true to the star’s established vocal style.</p>

<h2>The Impact of the Singles: Chart Success from 1985 to 1986</h2>

<p>A crucial measure of the commercial success and enduring relevance of any album is the performance of its singles. <strong><em>Get to the Heart</em></strong> proved its strength by generating three separate charting singles released between 1985 and 1986. These tracks showcased the diverse emotional range of the album, from heartfelt ballads to upbeat, affirming tracks.</p>

<p>The sequencing of these releases ensured that <strong>Barbara Mandrell</strong> remained a fixture on country radio for over a year following the album’s debut. Each single contributed to establishing the identity of the <strong><em>Get to the Heart</em></strong> era as one focused on maturity, reflection, and powerful vocal delivery. It was a clear signal that the star was not only fully recovered but was entering a new phase of her career marked by powerful, sophisticated material.</p>

<p>The three singles released from <strong><em>Get to the Heart</em></strong> demonstrated Mandrell’s command over different sub-genres within the contemporary country framework:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>The Lead Single (1985):</strong> Often an upbeat track that defined the album’s sound, the lead single quickly became a radio mainstay. It introduced the album's slick, highly produced aesthetic and immediately garnered attention following her hiatus. Its success confirmed that Mandrell’s audience was eager for her return and appreciated her updated sound.</li>
    <li><strong>The Power Ballad (1985/1986):</strong> Following the initial success, the second single often delved into deeper emotional territory. These powerful, often soaring tracks allowed Mandrell to utilize the full strength and vulnerability of her voice. In the mid-80s, dramatic ballads were essential for cementing an artist’s longevity, and this track provided crucial chart success into the new year.</li>
    <li><strong>The Third Hit (1986):</strong> Extending the album’s promotional lifespan well into 1986, the final single demonstrated the depth of the tracklist. These later singles helped maintain the album’s presence on the charts, offering fans another glimpse into the versatile material produced by Tom Collins. This extended chart presence underscored the album’s widespread appeal across different radio formats.</li>
</ul>

<p>The consistency of these releases, all supported by the infrastructure of MCA Records, solidified <strong><em>Get to the Heart</em></strong> as a significant mid-career achievement for <strong>Barbara Mandrell</strong>. They were essential listening for anyone tracking the evolution of 80s Country Music.</p>

<h2>Critical Reception and Legacy within MCA Records</h2>

<p>Upon its release, <strong><em>Get to the Heart</em></strong> was generally well-received. Critics acknowledged the sensitivity and strength Mandrell brought to the material, especially given the public knowledge of her personal struggles the previous year. While some purists occasionally lamented the pronounced pop elements, the overall consensus praised the album's high production quality and the emotional honesty of the lyrics. It was viewed as a mature, professional work that maintained Mandrell’s relevance in a rapidly changing genre.</p>

<p>Commercially, the album performed respectably, continuing her streak of charting LPs for MCA. In the context of her impressive catalog—which included multi-platinum successes—<strong><em>Get to the Heart</em></strong> held its own by successfully transitioning her established sound into the decade’s requirements. The album provided necessary commercial momentum that enabled her to continue recording quality material throughout the latter half of the 1980s.</p>

<p>The album’s lasting legacy lies primarily in its role as a testament to Mandrell’s immense personal resilience. It demonstrated that she could face severe adversity and channel that experience into powerful, resonant music. It is impossible to discuss the transition of country music from the late 70s to the mid-80s without referencing artists like Mandrell who successfully bridged those decades, and <strong><em>Get to the Heart</em></strong> is a prime example of that successful navigation.</p>

<h2>Beyond Clean Cut: Defining the Mid-80s Sound</h2>

<p>The comparison between <strong><em>Get to the Heart</em></strong> and its predecessor, <em>Clean Cut</em> (1984), is crucial for understanding the specific stylistic choices made in 1985. While <em>Clean Cut</em> was a solid effort, it felt slightly more constrained by the traditional country expectations of the early 80s. <strong><em>Get to the Heart</em></strong>, however, fully embraced the sonic opportunities available mid-decade.</p>

<p>This album is often cited as a definitive example of how Nashville utilized sophisticated engineering and session musicianship to create albums that were impeccably smooth. The attention paid to vocal layering and instrumental clarity in <strong><em>Get to the Heart</em></strong> elevated the material beyond standard country radio fare, making it appealing to a broader Adult Contemporary audience. It showcased Mandrell not just as a country star, but as a mainstream vocalist capable of competing with pop artists of the era.</p>

<p>For collectors and fans who appreciate the specific aesthetic of 80s country—the reverb, the synths, and the polished arrangements—<strong><em>Get to the Heart</em></strong> is a masterful recording. It perfectly captures the essence of the mid-1980s, a period where traditional boundaries blurred and artistic risks often yielded immense rewards. Mandrell, through this album, proved once again that she was one step ahead of the curve.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: The Enduring Message of Resilience</h2>

<p>Released in August 1985, <strong>Barbara Mandrell’s <em>Get to the Heart</em></strong> stands as a powerful symbol of artistic and personal triumph. As her sixteenth solo studio album, it confirmed her status as one of country music's most enduring stars, effortlessly adapting to the changing soundscape while maintaining emotional sincerity.</p>

<p>Under the expert guidance of Tom Collins, and through the promotional backing of MCA Records, <strong><em>Get to the Heart</em></strong> delivered three memorable singles and solidified Mandrell’s sound for the mid-80s. More than just a collection of successful songs, it is a testament to the resilience required of a superstar navigating public life and professional challenges. For anyone seeking to understand the evolution of the country-pop sound in 1985, or simply wishing to hear Barbara Mandrell at her most powerful and reflective, <strong><em>Get to the Heart</em></strong> remains an essential listen.</p>
