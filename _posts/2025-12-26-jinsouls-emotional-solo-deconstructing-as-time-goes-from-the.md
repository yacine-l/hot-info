<h2>Jinsoul's Voice Takes Center Stage: The Power of "As Time Goes"</h2>
<p>In the highly competitive world of K-Pop, the transition from group idol to successful solo artist often requires strategic moves that showcase unique vocal talents outside the group's established sound. For Kim Jin-sol, better known by her stage name Jinsoul, a primary vocalist and rapper of the globally recognized girl group LOONA, this opportunity arrived in the form of a delicate, emotionally resonant soundtrack contribution.</p>

<p>The song, titled <strong>"As Time Goes"</strong> (시간이 멈춰있던 곳), was recorded for the official soundtrack (OST) of the popular 2020 K-Drama <em>Welcome</em> (also known as <em>Meow, the Secret Boy</em>). Released on April 15, 2020, this digital single instantly drew attention, not just from LOONA's dedicated fandom, Orbit, but also from K-drama enthusiasts who appreciated the track's profound melancholy and elegant arrangement. It marked a significant milestone: a solo opportunity that allowed Jinsoul’s distinct vocal texture and ability to convey deep emotion to shine, completely independently of the powerful, synchronized sound that defines LOONA.</p>

<p>The success of the <strong>Jinsoul As Time Goes OST</strong> cemented her status as a versatile artist capable of handling both explosive dance tracks and intimate ballad performances. This article explores the depth of the track, its role within the drama, and the broader impact it had on Jinsoul's burgeoning individual career.</p>

<h2>Melancholy Melodies: Deconstructing "As Time Goes"</h2>
<p>"As Time Goes" is a masterpiece of soft, ambient balladry, meticulously crafted to evoke feelings of quiet longing and introspection. Unlike many K-Pop OST tracks which utilize soaring crescendos for dramatic effect, this song relies on subtlety and atmosphere.</p>

<p>The instrumental composition is built primarily upon a gentle piano melody, complemented by sparse, orchestral strings that swell gently during the chorus. This minimal instrumentation places immense focus on Jinsoul’s voice. Known traditionally for her powerful mid-to-high register and clear tone within LOONA’s complex harmonies, here she employs a softer, more delicate approach, allowing vulnerability to be the key textural element.</p>

<h3>Key Musical Features:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Vocal Delivery:</strong> Jinsoul utilizes a breathy, controlled vocal delivery, emphasizing the narrative of the lyrics—a tale of time standing still due to deep emotion or separation.</li>
    <li><strong>Instrumentation:</strong> Dominated by piano and layered with subtle cello and violin, creating a contemplative atmosphere.</li>
    <li><strong>Emotional Arc:</strong> The song maintains a steady, mournful pace, mirroring the slow progression of time when one is waiting or reflecting on the past.</li>
    <li><strong>Genre Fusion:</strong> While classified as a ballad, it contains elements of light R&B vocal inflections, particularly in the harmonization during the latter half of the track.</li>
</ul>

<p>The lyrics themselves reflect the common themes found in dramatic OSTs: yearning, separation, and the desire for time to rewind or halt entirely. This sense of timeless devotion is exactly what the drama <em>Welcome</em> required, making the <strong>Jinsoul Welcome OST</strong> component essential to the show’s emotional anchoring.</p>

<h2>Scoring the Romance: "As Time Goes" in the Context of Welcome (Meow, the Secret Boy)</h2>
<p>To fully appreciate "As Time Goes," one must understand the emotional landscape of the drama it accompanies. <em>Welcome</em> (also titled <em>Meow, the Secret Boy</em>) is a romantic fantasy series based on a webtoon, starring Kim Myung-soo (L) and Shin Ye-eun.</p>

<p>The plot centers around a cat, Hong-jo (played by L), who can transform into a human man. This premise sets up an inherent conflict rooted in secrecy, temporary existence, and the deep, often painful bond between human and non-human. The drama is characterized by moments of fleeting happiness, inevitable heartbreak, and complicated hidden identities.</p>

<p>The <strong>Jinsoul As Time Goes OST</strong> was strategically used during pivotal, heartfelt moments, particularly those involving the main couple's deepening bond or the realization of the limitations and challenges facing their relationship. Its melancholic sound underscored the quiet pain that lies beneath the fantasy element, enhancing viewer investment in the characters’ bittersweet journey.</p>

<h3>The Role of K-Drama OSTs:</h3>
<p>Original Soundtracks are fundamental pillars of K-drama success. They are not merely background music; they are emotional cues that often dictate how viewers should feel during a scene. A powerful OST can elevate a scene from standard drama to unforgettable cinematic experience. For <em>Welcome</em>, "As Time Goes" provided the necessary gravitas and sincerity needed for the more somber romantic developments.</p>
<p>The production team behind the OST, Donuts Music N and Dreamus, are known for curating soundtracks that perfectly match the narrative tone, ensuring that Jinsoul’s track was seamlessly integrated into the drama's soundscape.</p>

<h2>Expanding the Orbit: Jinsoul’s Solo Discography and OST Ventures</h2>
<p>While Jinsoul had already established her solo identity prior to "As Time Goes" through LOONA’s pre-debut project, this OST represented a crucial evolution in her individual career portfolio.</p>

<p>Jinsoul’s pre-debut solo track, "Singing in the Rain" (released in 2017 as part of the LOONA ODD EYE CIRCLE sub-unit project), showcased a more energetic, synth-pop, and futuristic sound, incorporating powerful rapping and dynamic choreography. In contrast, "As Time Goes" stripped away the theatricality, presenting Jinsoul purely as a vocalist specializing in emotional connection.</p>

<p>This duality is essential for K-Pop idols seeking longevity. By proving her capability in the ballad genre, Jinsoul broadened her appeal beyond the established LOONA fanbase. OSTs are highly visible platforms; they introduce an idol’s voice to general listeners who may not follow K-Pop charts but are dedicated K-drama viewers.</p>

<h3>Significance of the OST to Jinsoul’s Career:</h3>
<p>Landing an OST spot, especially for a widely broadcasted drama like <em>Welcome</em>, provides several benefits:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Vocal Verification:</strong> It affirms her position as a lead vocalist capable of carrying a song entirely on her own merit.</li>
    <li><strong>Crossover Appeal:</strong> It exposes her talent to a broader, non-K-Pop audience.</li>
    <li><strong>Discography Diversification:</strong> It adds a mature, emotional track to a discography otherwise dominated by high-concept, group-based music.</li>
    <li><strong>Independent Success:</strong> It showcases her ability to achieve success outside the collective framework of LOONA.</li>
</ol>

<p>The reception to the <strong>Jinsoul As Time Goes OST</strong> was overwhelmingly positive, solidifying fan demand for more solo ballads or acoustic performances from the idol.</p>

<h2>Behind the Release: Production and Distribution</h2>
<p>The creation and release of the OST involved established industry partners who specialize in soundtrack production and distribution across South Korea.</p>

<p>"As Time Goes" was released as a digital single on April 15, 2020. The production was overseen by Donuts Music N, a company known for its work on numerous K-drama soundtracks. Distribution was handled by Dreamus, a major player in the Korean music industry, ensuring the track was widely available across streaming platforms, including Melon, Genie, and Spotify.</p>

<p>The seamless coordination between the drama’s producers and the music production companies ensured the track’s quality and timely release. The track served as Part 5 of the <em>Welcome</em> official soundtrack collection.</p>
