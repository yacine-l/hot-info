<h2>Introduction: The CPGB-ML Defined</h2>

<p>The political landscape of the United Kingdom is characterized by a complex array of parties, ranging from mainstream governing bodies to niche organizations upholding distinct ideological doctrines. Among these, the Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist–Leninist), universally known by its abbreviation, CPGB-ML, occupies a significant, if often marginalized, position.</p>

<p>The CPGB-ML distinguishes itself sharply from other communist or socialist groups in Britain by its uncompromising adherence to anti-revisionist Marxism-Leninism. While many modern Western communist parties have softened their positions following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the CPGB-ML maintains a fierce dedication to the principles developed by Lenin and, crucially, Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong. This commitment defines their entire political strategy and their interactions with the global revolutionary movement.</p>

<p>The party is active across England, Scotland, and Wales, consistently promoting a revolutionary line against both Western imperialism and what it terms ‘social-imperialism’ and ‘Euro-revisionism.’ The CPGB-ML does not merely represent a splinter group; it embodies a philosophical and organizational commitment to a particular strain of communist thought that prioritizes the dictatorship of the proletariat and unwavering solidarity with existing or historical anti-imperialist states.</p>

<h2>The Genesis: Harpal Brar and the 2004 Split</h2>

<p>The founding of the CPGB-ML was not an instantaneous event but the culmination of internal political struggles stemming from the broader Marxist movement in Britain during the late 20th century. The party officially came into existence on 3 July 2004, initiated by a definitive split led by prominent communist figure Harpal Brar.</p>

<p>Before the split, Brar and his comrades were members of the Socialist Labour Party (SLP), a party founded by Arthur Scargill after his departure from the Labour Party. The SLP itself had attracted various factions committed to hard-line socialist principles. However, deep ideological and organizational differences emerged concerning how the proletariat should organize and what constituted true Marxist-Leninist principles in the modern era.</p>

<p>Brar’s faction argued that the SLP was failing to adhere rigorously enough to revolutionary Marxist–Leninist principles, particularly concerning anti-revisionism and anti-imperialist solidarity. They felt the SLP was drifting toward reformist or opportunistic tendencies. The formal establishment of the CPGB-ML in 2004 marked a clean break, dedicated to creating a party whose political program was unreservedly aligned with the historical lineage of revolutionary communism, viewing figures like Khrushchev and later Soviet leaders as betrayers of the original revolutionary ideals.</p>

<p>The formation of the CPGB-ML ensured the establishment of a robust organizational structure designed to withstand internal ideological dissent and external political pressure, focusing primarily on disseminating theoretical clarity through publications rather than concentrating solely on electoral politics.</p>

<h2>Defining the Core Ideology: Anti-Revisionism and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat</h2>

<p>To understand the CPGB-ML, one must grasp the meaning of ‘anti-revisionism.’ In Marxist–Leninist terminology, revisionism refers to the adulteration or betrayal of core Marxist principles. For the CPGB-ML, the first major act of revisionism occurred after the death of Joseph Stalin, specifically with Nikita Khrushchev’s Secret Speech in 1956, which inaugurated a period of ‘peaceful coexistence’ and market-oriented reforms in the USSR.</p>

<p>The CPGB-ML strongly aligns itself with the ideological struggles waged by leaders such as Mao Zedong in China and Enver Hoxha in Albania against this perceived Soviet revisionism. Their ideology is characterized by:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Defense of Stalin and Mao:</strong> They vigorously defend the historical contributions of Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong, viewing their periods of leadership as crucial steps in constructing socialism, often characterizing criticisms of their eras as bourgeois propaganda.</li>
    <li><strong>Rejection of Social Democracy:</strong> The party dismisses the idea of achieving socialism through parliamentary means or gradual reform. They advocate for the necessity of a revolutionary seizure of power and the establishment of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat.</li>
    <li><strong>Anti-Imperialism First:</strong> The primary global contradiction is viewed as that between imperialism (led by the US and NATO) and the oppressed nations and peoples of the world. Therefore, supporting any state or movement actively resisting Western hegemony—regardless of its internal structure—is paramount.</li>
</ul>

<p>This strict adherence to the historical materialist dialectic, free from what they perceive as opportunistic 'modernization,' makes the CPGB-ML a crucial repository for orthodox Marxist thought in the UK.</p>

<h2>Leadership and Key Figures: Harpal Brar and Ella Rule</h2>

<p>The trajectory and philosophical grounding of the CPGB-ML are inextricably linked to its key leaders, both past and present, who have dedicated decades to the study and propagation of Marxist theory.</p>

<p><strong>Harpal Brar (Founder):</strong> Harpal Brar remains the defining figure of the CPGB-ML. As a prolific writer, theorist, and public speaker, Brar’s intellectual contributions laid the foundation for the party’s anti-revisionist platform. His works often focus on defending historical communist figures, critiquing imperialism, and providing Marxist analysis of contemporary global crises. Brar’s uncompromising commitment to ideological purity gave the CPGB-ML its specific character and magnetic appeal to those disillusioned with the perceived compromises of the wider British left.</p>

<p><strong>Ella Rule (Party Chair):</strong> Following the initial founding period, Ella Rule emerged as a crucial leader and currently serves as the party chair. Rule carries forward the party’s strict ideological line, ensuring organizational stability and continued adherence to anti-revisionist tenets. Her leadership is focused on internal education, coordinating international solidarity, and overseeing the party’s publications. Under Rule’s guidance, the CPGB-ML has maintained its distinctive voice in domestic and international political commentary.</p>

<h2>The Media Arm: Proletarian and Lalkar</h2>

<p>A central tenet of the CPGB-ML’s strategy is the use of media to educate the working class and disseminate revolutionary theory. For the party, media is not merely communication; it is a vital tool for organizing and raising class consciousness.</p>

<h3>Proletarian Newspaper</h3>

<p>The primary publication of the CPGB-ML is the newspaper <em>Proletarian</em>. Published bimonthly, <em>Proletarian</em> serves as the official mouthpiece of the party, covering UK domestic politics, international affairs, and theoretical discussions through a Marxist–Leninist lens. Its articles are designed to strip away bourgeois narratives, revealing the underlying class struggle and imperialist motivations behind political events.</p>

<p>The content frequently focuses on trade union struggles, housing crises, and anti-war movements, always tying these specific issues back to the larger structures of capitalist exploitation and imperialist oppression.</p>

<h3>Lalkar Journal</h3>

<p>Closely allied with the CPGB-ML is the Marxist–Leninist theoretical journal <em>Lalkar</em> (meaning ‘Challenge’ or ‘Call’ in Punjabi and Urdu). While not officially the party’s organ, <em>Lalkar</em> shares virtually identical ideological ground with the CPGB-ML and features contributions from party members and allied comrades.</p>

<p><em>Lalkar</em> focuses on deeper theoretical analysis, historical studies, and intensive ideological debates. It provides the intellectual framework that underpins the more immediate reporting found in <em>Proletarian</em>, helping to ground activists in profound Marxist scholarship and defend the legacies of revolutionary leaders.</p>

<h2>Political Mobilization and Anti-Imperialist Focus</h2>

<p>The CPGB-ML is primarily known for its uncompromising internationalist stance, which often places it in direct conflict with Western foreign policy narratives. The party views almost all conflicts through the prism of anti-imperialism, identifying NATO and the US as the primary drivers of global instability.</p>

<p>Key political campaigns and positions include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Solidarity with Resistant States:</strong> The CPGB-ML historically offers robust support for states and political organizations that are actively targeted by US-led imperialism. This includes countries like North Korea, Iran, and historical defense of regimes such as those in Iraq (under Saddam Hussein) and Libya (under Gaddafi) when they were under attack by Western powers.</li>
    <li><strong>Opposition to Militarism:</strong> The party is staunchly opposed to UK involvement in NATO and all imperialist wars, advocating for unilateral withdrawal from imperial alliances and the dismantling of British military infrastructure.</li>
    <li><strong>Defense of National Sovereignty:</strong> They emphasize the right of all nations to self-determination free from foreign intervention, criticizing humanitarian interventionism as a modern pretext for imperialist expansion.</li>
    <li><strong>Domestic Labour Organization:</strong> Domestically, the party seeks to organize workers within trade unions, pushing for militant action and combating collaborationist or reformist union leaderships.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The CPGB-ML’s Relationship with the British Left</h2>

<p>The CPGB-ML maintains a highly critical and independent position regarding the broader British left, including the Labour Party, the traditional trade union movement, and even other smaller communist groups.</p>

<p>The party views the Labour Party, even during periods of left-wing leadership, as an inherently bourgeois and imperialist organization incapable of delivering genuine socialist change. Their strategy involves working within mass organizations (like unions) but always maintaining a sharp ideological distance from organizations that seek reform within the existing capitalist framework.</p>

<p>Crucially, their anti-revisionist purity also leads to frequent theoretical conflicts with Trotskyist and Maoist organizations that interpret the history of the Soviet Union or the nature of class struggle differently. The CPGB-ML’s focus on the continuity of Stalinist principles places them outside the mainstream consensus of even the radical UK left.</p>

<h2>The Enduring Relevance of Anti-Revisionism</h2>

<p>While numerically small compared to major political parties, the CPGB-ML plays a unique role in British political life. It serves as a political and intellectual anchor for those who believe that the failures of 20th-century socialism were caused by the abandonment of revolutionary principles, not by the principles themselves.</p>

<p>In a world increasingly polarized by global conflict, rising economic inequality, and renewed great power competition, the anti-imperialist framework championed by the CPGB-ML retains a potent, albeit niche, appeal. By consistently drawing links between domestic austerity, global war, and the exploitative nature of capitalism, the party offers a radical analysis that challenges the fundamental assumptions of liberal democracy and mainstream socialist politics.</p>

<p>The commitment of the CPGB-ML to publishing rigorous theoretical work, especially through *Proletarian* and *Lalkar*, ensures that the doctrines of scientific socialism—as interpreted through the lens of Leninism and Stalinism—remain a living, debated, and organized political force in the United Kingdom.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist–Leninist) stands as a principled and unyielding communist formation within the UK. Founded on the anti-revisionist line of Harpal Brar, and currently chaired by Ella Rule, the CPGB-ML has maintained a steadfast ideological commitment since its 2004 inception.</p>

<p>Through its dedicated publications and its uncompromising political stances, the CPGB-ML continues to call for a revolutionary end to imperialism and capitalism, preserving an often-controversial but historically significant current of Marxist thought that refuses to concede any ground to reformism or opportunism.</p>
