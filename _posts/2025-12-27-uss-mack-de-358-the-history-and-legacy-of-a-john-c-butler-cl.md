<p>In the vast, logistical undertaking that was the Pacific Theater of World War II, victory hinged not just on major fleet actions but on the tireless efforts of smaller, specialized vessels tasked with protecting the supply chain. Among these essential ships was the <strong>USS Mack (DE-358)</strong>. Commissioned in the critical late stages of the war, <em>Mack</em> was a highly capable example of the John C. Butler-class destroyer escort—a class designed specifically for the relentless demands of convoy protection and anti-submarine warfare (ASW).</p>

<p>Serving for a brief but intense two-year period (1944–1946), the <em>Mack</em> fulfilled her design purpose, navigating the dangerous waters of the western Pacific. Although her operational career was short, her contribution to securing America’s lifeline across the globe was invaluable. This article delves into the construction, operational history, and ultimate fate of DE-358, examining why this particular class of escort was so crucial to Allied success and how her legacy endured decades after her decommissioning.</p>

<h2>The Genesis of Necessity: The John C. Butler-Class Destroyer Escort</h2>

<p>The concept of the Destroyer Escort (DE) was born out of desperate necessity during the early years of World War II. The United States and Great Britain were losing the Battle of the Atlantic to German U-boats, and the massive naval shipbuilding programs needed a vessel that could be produced quickly and affordably while still possessing the necessary speed and armament for escort duty. The standard destroyer was too costly and too slow to produce in the required numbers.</p>

<p>The John C. Butler-class, to which the USS Mack belonged, was one of the most successful and longest-running DE designs. Named for Ensign John C. Butler, who was killed during the Battle of Midway, the class represented an excellent balance of capability and production efficiency. These ships were smaller than standard destroyers, yet large enough to carry powerful radar, sonar, and a robust array of anti-submarine weaponry.</p>

<h3>Key Design Features of DE-358</h3>

<p>The <em>Mack</em>, like her sister ships, was designed to be effective under austere wartime conditions. Her specifications reflected a focus on durability, range, and specialized ASW capabilities:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Length and Displacement:</strong> Approximately 306 feet (93 meters) long, displacing about 1,350 tons standard.</li>
    <li><strong>Propulsion:</strong> Powered by turbine-electric drive, allowing for reliable cruising and an operational speed of around 24 knots.</li>
    <li><strong>Primary Armament:</strong> Typically mounted three 3-inch/50 caliber dual-purpose guns for surface and anti-aircraft defense.</li>
    <li><strong>Anti-Submarine Weaponry:</strong> Equipped with K-gun depth charge projectors, hedgehogs (anti-submarine mortar), and depth charge racks, making them formidable submarine hunters.</li>
</ul>

<p>The design ensured that the U.S. Navy could mass-produce these vessels in various shipyards, rapidly filling the critical need for ocean escorts in both the Atlantic and, increasingly, the Pacific theaters.</p>

<h2>Construction and Naming: Honoring Lieutenant Robert T. Mack</h2>

<p>The USS Mack was laid down on 30 October 1943, at the formidable shipyards of the Consolidated Steel Corporation in Orange, Texas. This site was crucial to the mass production of the DE fleet, utilizing assembly-line techniques to launch hulls at an astonishing rate.</p>

<p>The ship was christened in honor of Lieutenant Robert T. Mack, USNR, a brave naval aviator. Lt. Mack tragically lost his life on 24 August 1942, while participating in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons. Flying a torpedo plane from the carrier USS Enterprise (CV-6), he was shot down while delivering a decisive attack against Japanese forces. Honoring individuals like Lt. Mack by naming these workhorse escort ships was a common practice, instilling a sense of purpose and sacrifice into the vessel’s identity.</p>

<p>The USS Mack (DE-358) was commissioned into service on 27 May 1944, under the command of Lieutenant Commander H. W. Smith, USNR. Following a demanding shakedown cruise in Bermuda, the ship prepared for transit to the Pacific, the theater where her services were most urgently required.</p>

<h2>Into the Crucible: Wartime Service in the Pacific (1944–1945)</h2>

<p>Upon completing her training, <em>Mack</em> transited the Panama Canal and reported for duty in the vast operational area of the Pacific Fleet. By late 1944, the American push toward the Japanese Home Islands was relentless, necessitating massive logistical support and the protection of long supply routes stretching from the U.S. West Coast to forward bases in the Philippines and Okinawa.</p>

<h3>Convoy Duty and Logistics Protection</h3>

<p>The primary role of DE-358 was straightforward: ensure the safe passage of vital logistics convoys. These convoys included everything from tankers carrying aviation fuel to transports loaded with troops, ammunition, and construction materials. The threat was twofold: Japanese submarines (which, though less numerous than U-boats, were highly dangerous) and the increasing danger of aerial attacks, particularly by kamikaze aircraft as the war neared its end.</p>

<p><em>Mack’s</em> early service involved escorting high-value convoys between key staging areas, including Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok, and Ulithi Atoll. Ulithi, in particular, served as a crucial advance naval base for the massive Third and Fifth Fleets, and keeping its supply lines open was non-negotiable.</p>

<h3>Supporting the Final Campaigns</h3>

<p>As 1945 began, the USS Mack was integrated into operations supporting the crucial island-hopping campaigns. While she may not have participated in the massive surface battles that characterized earlier parts of the war, her work was foundational to success:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Philippines Reinforcement:</strong> <em>Mack</em> played a part in guarding supply lines feeding the extensive operations in and around the Philippines, ensuring that Allied ground forces received continuous support during the long campaign to retake the islands.</li>
    <li><strong>Okinawa Operation:</strong> The Battle of Okinawa (April–June 1945) was the bloodiest operation of the Pacific War and saw the heaviest use of kamikaze attacks. Destroyer Escorts were often placed on the dangerous "picket lines"—rings of smaller ships surrounding the main fleet to provide early warning of incoming Japanese aircraft. Although specific records detailing sustained combat are sparse, all ships on the Okinawa perimeter faced continuous, intense air threat, demonstrating the resilience and vital importance of the DEs as mobile anti-aircraft platforms.</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout these demanding duties, the crew of the <em>Mack</em> maintained constant readiness, a testament to the high standard of training required for ASW and anti-aircraft operations.</p>

<h2>Post-War Transition and Decommissioning (1945–1946)</h2>

<p>Following the Japanese surrender in August 1945, the role of many frontline vessels abruptly changed. For the USS Mack, the transition involved repatriation duties and preparations for reduction to reserve status. She participated in clearing up operational areas and assisting with the movement of Allied personnel before being ordered back to the continental United States.</p>

<p>Upon her return, <em>Mack</em> prepared for entry into the "Mothball Fleet." The U.S. Navy faced the monumental task of demobilizing the massive force built during the war. Thousands of ships, many of which were still relatively new, were preserved against future needs in protected anchorages.</p>

<p>The USS Mack (DE-358) was formally decommissioned on 28 June 1946, and assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet, specifically anchored at San Diego, California. Her operational service was officially over, but her long career of waiting had just begun. Preserved crews diligently maintained the reserve ships, hoping to reactivate them if a new global conflict arose, as indeed happened with many ships during the Korean War.</p>

<h2>The Long Silence: Reserve Status and Final Disposition (1946–1973)</h2>

<p>For nearly three decades, the USS Mack remained moored in reserve. The John C. Butler-class was designed for the specific tactical requirements of WWII, and by the 1960s, rapid advancements in sonar technology, missile defense, and nuclear propulsion rendered most of the WWII-era destroyer escorts technologically obsolete for frontline service.</p>

<p>Although some sister ships of the <em>Mack</em> were reactivated or transferred to allied navies (particularly during the 1950s), DE-358 was never recalled to active duty. As the years progressed and the technological gap widened, the cost of modernization became prohibitive. The decision was ultimately made to dispose of the aging hull.</p>

<h3>Final Disposition</h3>

<p>The USS Mack (DE-358) was officially stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 December 1972. This action marked the end of her official naval career. Within months, the ship was sold for scrap. In 1973, the hull of the USS Mack was broken up for salvage. The date of her scrapping in 1973 places her among the final wave of mass disposal of WWII-era vessels, closing the book on an entire generation of naval architecture and warfare.</p>

<h2>The Lasting Legacy of the USS Mack (DE-358)</h2>

<p>While the USS Mack’s service record might appear modest compared to carriers or battleships, her history is representative of the vast, collective effort that won the Pacific War. Destroyer Escorts were the unsung heroes of naval logistics. They safeguarded the flow of materials that allowed American forces to operate thousands of miles from their home ports, and their sheer numbers overwhelmed the enemy’s submarine capabilities.</p>

<p>The legacy of the USS Mack is preserved in several key areas:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Protecting the Supply Lines:</strong> Her service ensured that crucial materials reached the frontline forces during the critical final campaigns of the war, including the pivotal Battle of Okinawa.</li>
    <li><strong>The Butler Class Success:</strong> She serves as an enduring symbol of the highly successful John C. Butler-class, a testament to effective wartime industrial production and design.</li>
    <li><strong>Honoring Sacrifice:</strong> She forever carries the name of Lt. Robert T. Mack, ensuring his sacrifice remains a part of naval history.</li>
</ul>

<p>The USS Mack (DE-358) may have ended her life in a scrapyard in 1973, but the years she spent defending the freedom of the seas, both on patrol and in strategic reserve, cement her position as a vital piece of the United States Navy’s World War II heritage.</p>

<p>For historians and naval enthusiasts, the story of DE-358 is a powerful reminder that victory in a global conflict demands not only powerful battleships but also the unwavering commitment of the smaller, tirelessly dedicated escort vessels.</p>
